0,201411,CALIFORNIA,CONTACTED NORCAL APPROACH WHILE VFR BETWEEN SANTA CRUZ AND SAN JOSE; ABOUT 15NM SOUTH OF SJC; AND TOLD THE CONTROLLER OUR DESTINATION WAS ZZZ; EAST OF SAN JOSE INTERNATIONAL.  I ASKED WHETHER IT WOULD BE EASIER IF I WENT ABOVE SAN JOSE INTERNATIONAL (ON OUR FLIGHT TO SANTA CRUZ WE FLEW OVER SAN JOSE INTERNATIONAL AT 3500 FT); OR MADE A LOW-LEVEL TRANSITION.  THE CONTROLLER INFORMED ME THAT WHATEVER I REQUESTED; HE WOULD ACCOMMODATE US.  HE GAVE ME AN IFF CODE; AND I REPLIED THAT AS SOON AS I CLEARED THE HILLS; I WOULD DESCEND TO AROUND 1000 FEET FOR MY TRANSITION TO ZZZ. AFTER CLEARING THE HILLS; WE DESCENDED TO BETWEEN 1500 AND 1000 FEET AND PROCEEDED TO ZZZ; GENERALLY FOLLOWING THE 680 FREEWAY.  AS WE APPROACHED SAN JOSE CLASS C; I EXPECTED A FREQUENCY CHANGE; SINCE NONE WAS GIVEN; I ASSUMED APPROACH HAD COORDINATED CLEARANCE THROUGH THE SAN JOSE CLASS C AREA; AND I PROCEEDED TO ZZZ; NO OTHER TRAFFIC APPEARED TO BE IN THE VICINITY (ON TCAS).  NORCAL APPROACH WAS HANDLING TWO OR THREE OTHER AIRCRAFT ON OUR FREQUENCY DURING OUR TRANSITION TO ZZZ.  FOLLOWING THE FREEWAY; WE TURNED FINAL FOR ZZZ; AND I CONTACTED APPROACH AND STATED WE WERE ON FINAL;LANDING ASSURED.  NORCAL APPROACH REPLIED 'ROGER'; THEN A FEW SECONDS LATER STATED; 'FREQUENCY CHANGE APPROVED; SQUAWK VFR.'  AFTER DROPPING THE PASSENGER; STARTED THE AIRCRAFT AND CONTACTED SAN JOSE TOWER FOR DEPARTURE.  AFTER RECEIVING CLEARANCE FOR DEPARTURE; THE CONTROLLER ASKED ME TO CONTACT THEM BY PHONE AND GAVE ME A NUMBER FOR THE TOWER SUPERVISOR.  HE STATED THEY WANTED TO DISCUSS A PILOT DEVIATION.  CONTACTED THE SUPERVISOR AFTER WE RETURNED TO BASE.  HE INFORMED ME THAT THEY HAD AN UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT THAT TRANSITED THEIR AIRSPACE; CROSSING THE FINAL APPROACH FOR RWY 30; THEN GOING IN TO REID-HILLVIEW AIRSPACE BEFORE DESCENDING AND GOING BACK INTO SAN JOSE'S CLASS C AND LANDING AT ZZZ.  I TOLD HIM THAT WAS ME; AND EXPLAINED THAT I HAD CONTACTED NORCAL APPROACH FOR THE TRANSITION; HAD BEEN GIVEN A SQUAWK CODE; AND HAD NEVER BEEN INSTRUCTED TO CHANGE FREQUENCIES UNTIL LANDING.  I ALSO TOLD THE SUPERVISOR THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS A LITTLE ODD THAT I WASN'T SWITCHED TO SAN JOSE TOWER; BUT ASSUMED THEY HAD COORDINATED THE TRANSITION THROUGH TOWER'S AREA.  THE SUPERVISOR SAID THAT THERE WAS ONE OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE CLASS C AT THE TIME; BUT IT WAS MUCH HIGHER THAN OUR AIRCRAFT; SO THERE WERE NO TRAFFIC CONFLICTS DURING OUR TRANSIT.  THE TOWER SUPERVISOR SUGGESTED THAT IF IT SEEMS ODD NOT TO BE TALKING TO THE TOWER; IT'S PROBABLY BEST TO ASK ABOUT A FREQUENCY CHANGE.  HOWEVER; I TOLD HIM THAT DURING MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE FLYING IN THE BAY AREA; WHEN WE WERE VECTORED THROUGH AIRPORT CLASS C AREAS AND ASKED ABOUT FREQUENCY CHANGES; THE CONTROLLERS GENERALLY STATED THAT OUR TRANSITIONS THROUGH THE CLASS C WERE COORDINATED; SO THERE WAS NO NEED TO TALK TO EACH TOWER.  SINCE WE WERE A MEDEVAC FLIGHT LAST NIGHT; I ASSUMED THE SAME COORDINATION TOOK PLACE BETWEEN NORCAL APPROACH AND SAN JOSE TOWER TO GET US TO OUR DESTINATION; AS I WAS NOT DIRECTED TO CHANGE FREQUENCIES.  THE SUPERVISOR AGREED AND SAID APPROACH PROBABLY COULD HAVE HANDLED IT BETTER; BUT THEY WERE PROCEEDING WITH A REQUIRED INVESTIGATION.  THE SUPERVISOR ASKED FOR MY NAME; FAA LICENSE NUMBER; AND CONTACT INFORMATION; WHICH I PROVIDED.,Pilot reports of being questioned about violating Class C airspace; while being under flight following from the overlying TRACON.,2014,11
1,201411,INDIANA,WHEN I RELIEVED THE CONTROLLER AT R18/20 I WAS BRIEFED ABOUT THE POSSIBLE ISSUES WITH THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN R3403 AND THE ASSOCIATED JPG MOA.  THE CONTROLLER AND FLM BOTH ADVISED THAT AIRCRAFT X HAD SPILLED OUT OF THE PROTECTED AIRSPACE MULTIPLE TIMES AND THE SUPERVISOR INFORMED ME HE WAS TRYING TO CONTACT THE RANGE CONTROLLER TO GET MORE INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON; BUT WHAT HE KNEW AT THAT POINT WAS THE AIRCRAFT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 'DROPPING OFF DIVERS' (THERE WAS CONFUSION ON IF THAT MEANT PARACHUTE OPERATIONS; OR THE AIRCRAFT WAS LANDING AND OFFLOADING THEM?). I WAS ALSO BRIEFED THERE WAS AN AIRCRAFT Z SOMEWHERE FLYING THAT HAD BEEN THROUGH THE AIRSPACE AND MAY BE BACK AT SOME POINT.  I HAD A TRACK ON AIRCRAFT X AND CONTINUED TO WATCH THE AIRCRAFT DO A CIRCULAR HOLDING PATTERN THAT CAUSED THE AIRCRAFT TO GO INTO AND OUT OF THE PROTECTED AIRSPACE.  THE AREA THE AIRCRAFT WAS CIRCLING AROUND WAS ALSO AN AREA THAT HAD A NOTAM OUT FOR UAV AIRCRAFT ACTIVITY.  I DO NOT REMEMBER THE EXACT SPECIFICS BUT IT WAS CLOSE TO 3NM IN DIAMETER 3500 MSL AND BELOW; WITH A CENTER POINT OF OVO090003.  I WAS ALSO BRIEFED THAT IND ATCT; CVG ATCT; AND SDF ATCT HAD ALL BEEN UPDATED ABOUT THE SITUATION.WHEN I SAT DOWN I DECIDED TO CALL EACH APPROACH CONTROL TO CONFIRM THEY HAD BEEN UPDATED AND SEE IF THEY HAD ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.  WHEN I SPOKE WITH IND ATCT THEY SAID THEY SAW THE LIMITED AND WOULD PROTECT FROM THAT AIRCRAFT AND THAT AIRSPACE IN GENERAL.  WHEN I SPOKE WITH CVG ATCT THEY ALSO SAW THE LIMITED BUT HAD A QUESTION AS TO WHAT ALTITUDE THAT JPG D MOA WAS HOT TO BECAUSE PART OF THE FLIGHT PATH AIRCRAFT X HAD BEEN FLYING WAS INSIDE THE LATERAL BOUNDARY OF JGD D BUT ABOVE THE ALTITUDE CAP OF 040 SINCE AIRCRAFT X WAS FLYING AT 100 OR 110.  THEY ASKED ME TO CONFIRM WHAT ALTITUDE THE JPD D WAS 'HOT' TO.TO ERROR ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION I TOLD THEM TO SHOW THE JGD D AIRSPACE HOT TO 130; WHICH IS THE TOP OF CVG ATCT AIRSPACE.  I DO NOT KNOW THE FULL RAMIFICATIONS OF THIS BUT WHEN DOING SO I KNEW THIS WOULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT THE NORTHWEST DEPARTURE COURSE OUT OF CVG.  WHEN I SPOKE WITH SDF ATCT THEY INFORMED ME THEY WERE TALKING TO AIRCRAFT Y WHO WAS CURRENTLY HOLDING AT THE ABB VOR AND PLANNING ON ENTERING THE JPG MOA AT SOME POINT; BUT THEY WERE NOT SURE WHAT THE AIRCRAFT PLANS WERE AFTER THEY ENTERED THE JGP MOA.  THEY ALSO WANTED TO KNOW IF THEY SHOULD HAVE AIRCRAFT Y STAY ON HIS CURRENT ASSIGNED BEACON CODE OR NOT.  I ASKED THEM TO LEAVE HIM ON HIS CURRENT ASSIGNED CODE SO I WOULD BE ABLE TO TRACK THE FLIGHT.AT THAT POINT I PULLED UP A TRACK ON AIRCRAFT Y.  I THEN WATCHED AIRCRAFT Y (TIME UNKNOWN) ENTER THE JPD MOA FROM THE SOUTH AND TRACK DIRECTLY NORTHEAST TO THE SAME HOLDING PATTERN AS AIRCRAFT X AROUND THE UAV AREA; IN DOING SO AIRCRAFT Y SPILLED OUT THE NORTH SIDE OF THE JPG MOA AND INTO MY AIRSPACE WITH NO RADIO CALLS.  AT SOME POINT DURING ALL OF THIS MY SUPERVISOR INFORMED ME THAT HE HAD SPOKEN WITH THE RANGE CONTROLLER AND THEY WERE 'NOT SURE EXACTLY WHAT WAS GOING ON; BUT THEY NEEDED TO FLY IN THOSE AREAS TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR MISSION'.  HE ALSO INFORMED ME THE RANGE CONTROLLER HAD TOLD HIM WHEN THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT GO OUTSIDE OF THE PROTECTED AIRSPACE AND INTO MINE 'THEY ARE OPERATING VFR'.  I QUESTIONED HIM ON THIS AND HOW THAT WAS ACCEPTABLE FOR US TO RUN OPERATIONS AND HE TOLD ME HE HAD THE SAME CONCERNS BUT THAT WAS THE ANSWER HE WAS GIVEN BY THE RANGE CONTROLLER AND THE OPERATIONS MANAGER HERE AT ZID.  AT THAT POINT I CALLED ALL THREE APPROACH CONTROLS AND UPDATED THEM THAT 'THEY ARE OPERATING VFR OUTSIDE OF PROTECTED AIRSPACE' BUT TO USE EXTREME CAUTION AND JUST BECAUSE THEY ARE 'VFR' DOESN'T MEAN WE DO NOT HAVE TO PROTECT FROM THEM.  AS I WAS BEING RELIEVED I BRIEFED THE INCOMING CONTROLLER OF WHAT WAS GOING ON AND THAT THEY EXPECTED THE ACTIVITY TO BE DONE IN THE NEXT HOUR TO HOUR AND A HALF.  AFTER I HAD COMPLETED MY OVERLAP AND PUT MY HEADSET UP I WENT BACK TO MAKE SURE THERE WERE NO QUESTIONS AND NOTICED A TRACK ON AIRCRAFT Z TO THE WEST OF THE AIRSPACE NEAR BFR AIRPORT BUT SINCE I WAS NOT PLUGGED IN I DO NOT KNOW WHAT ROLE THAT AIRCRAFT PLAYED IN THE SITUATION.SINCE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED I REVIEWED THE LOA'S FOR R3403 AND THE JPG MOA TO MAKE SURE I HAD NOT BEEN AWARE OF SOME 'OPERATING VFR OUTSIDE PROTECTED AIRSPACE' PORTION OF THE LOA.  IN THE IT VERY CLEARLY DEFINES HOW AIRCRAFT ARE SUPPOSED TO ENTER AND EXIT THE PROTECTED AIRSPACE BOTH IN VFR AND IFR CONDITIONS.  I FEEL THAT BY US (ZID) ALLOWING THE MILITARY TO OPERATE OUTSIDE THE CONFINES OF THE LOA WITHOUT RECOURSE WE ARE PROMOTING AN UNSAFE CULTURE THAT WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD TO A REAL ACCIDENT/INCIDENT.  I ALSO KNOW THAT IFR/VFR SEPARATION HAS BEEN ONE OF THE TOP 5 CONCERNS AND FEEL BY ALLOWING THE MILITARY TO SAY WE ARE 'OPERATING VFR' DOES NOT REMOVE ANY RISK; BUT INSTEAD PROBABLY ADDS TO IT.  IN THE LOA IT CLEARLY DEFINES IF THE MILITARY NEEDS ADDITIONAL AIRSPACE THE PROCEDURES FOR MAKING THOSE REQUESTS.  I ALSO HAVE NOTICED A MAJOR INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF UAV ACTIVITY AT THIS LOCATION OVER THE PAST 6 MONTHS AND WAS EVEN BRIEFED BY MY FLM APPROXIMATELY A YEAR AGO DURING A TEAM MEETING ABOUT THE UAV ACTIVITY AT MASKATUC/JEFFERSON PROVING GROUNDS.  I HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS:1- REVISIT THE R3403 AND JPG MOA LOA'S AND ADD TO THEM PROCEDURES THAT INCLUDE OPERATIONS FOR THE UAV ACTIVITIES.2- FULLY INVESTIGATE THIS INCIDENT AND THEN BRIEF ALL CONTROLLERS/MILITARY USING THIS AIRSPACE SO WE CAN LEARN FROM THIS INCIDENT.  LASTLY I AM A MEMBER OF OUR LOCAL BEST PRACTICES WORK GROUP HERE AT ZID AND WE HAVE BEEN WORKING TO BETTER OPEN UP COMMUNICATION WITH OUR MILITARY USERS.,ZID Controller describes a situation where an aircraft is outside of a Restricted Area maneuvering while IFR.,2014,11
2,201411,MICHIGAN,AROUND NOON I WAS PERFORMING AN AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY MISSION AND WITH THE LOW CEILINGS AND TURBULENCE; I GOT TOO LOW WHILE SHOOTING AND CIRCLING OVER MY TARGET. APPARENTLY A DRONE OPERATOR WAS OPERATING IN THE SAME VICINITY AND COMPLAINED THAT I WAS FLYING TOO LOW! I THINK AT ONE POINT I MIGHT HAVE BEEN 6-700 FEET AGL MOMENTARILY IN AN AREA THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A CONGESTED AREA DEPENDING WHICH SIDE OF THE ROAD YOU WERE ON. I SEE UP AND COMING ISSUES WITH DRONES DOWN LOW IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER CONFLICTING WITH LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT. THEY ARE STARTING REACH UP CLOSE TO OUR OPERATING BANDS.I WILL BE WATCHING MY ALTITUDE MORE CAREFULLY AND FOR DRONES IN MY AIRSPACE TOO.,Aerial survey pilot; operating at 600-700 feet AGL due to weather; is informed after the fact that he may have flown too close to a drone operating in the same area.,2014,11
3,201411,NEW MEXICO,I WAS FLYING TO PHOENIX; AZ. UPON PASSING NORTH OF THE TAOS; NM AREA (SKI AREA VISIBLE FROM AIRPLANE) SHORTLY THEREAFTER; OUR AIRCRAFT (I BELIEVE A BOEING 737) HAD AN AIRCRAFT PASS DIRECTLY ABOVE IT WITH MY APPROXIMATE ESTIMATED DISTANCE OF ABOUT 200 VERTICAL FEET BETWEEN AIRCRAFT AND ZERO FEET HORIZONTALLY BETWEEN AIRCRAFT. WE HAD BEEN FLYING IN A WESTERLY DIRECTION (MY GUESS LOOKING OUT THE WINDOW AT THE GROUND IS SOMEWHERE IN THE APPROXIMATE 35;000 - 40;000 FT RANGE WHEN AN UNIDENTIFIED AIRPLANE PASSED OVER THE TOP OF US FROM A NORTH - NORTHWEST DIRECTION TOWARD A SOUTH - SOUTHEAST HEADING HAVING A DOUBLE CONTRAIL AND A BLUE BODY TO THE JET AIRCRAFT. THE AIRCRAFT PASSED SO QUICKLY AND ITS CONTRAILS WERE SO CLOSE I CONSIDER IT A NEAR MISS AND IN NO WAY IN LINE WITH FAA REGULATIONS THAT NORMALLY REQUIRE MILES BETWEEN AIRCRAFT. THE PILOT AND CREW OF [MY FLIGHT] HAD BEEN FLYING THEIR AIRCRAFT IN A STEADY AND DELIBERATE MANNER AND DID NOT VEER IN ANY WAY PRIOR OR AFTER THE OTHER AIRCRAFT PASSED OVERHEAD WHICH DID SO WITHOUT TURNING; ASCENDING OR DESCENDING. I BELIEVE THE CREW OF [MY FLIGHT] WAS LIKELY NOT EVEN AWARE OF THE OTHER AIRCRAFT DUE TO THE OTHER AIRCRAFT'S SIDEWAY DIRECTIONAL PATH TOWARD US; THE OTHER JET WAS LIKELY NOT VISIBLE TO THE CREW OR RADAR OF [MY FLIGHT]. HOWEVER; I WOULD FIND IT VERY HARD TO BELIEVE THE OTHER AIRCRAFT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE US.,B737 passenger alleges an NMAC occurred during a flight to PHX.,2014,11
4,201411,TEXAS,ON HRPER1 DEPARTURE FROM 18L; REGIONAL DEPARTURE GAVE US A TURN TOWARDS THE WEST PRIOR TO REACHING BPARK. AS WE WERE HEADING APPROXIMATELY 240 DEGREES THROUGH THE TURN AND PASSING ABOUT 4000 TO 4500 FEET MSL (APPROXIMATE POSITION NNE OF YAMEL); I SAW SOMETHING BELOW US THAT MADE ME DO A DOUBLE-TAKE. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A SMALL HELIUM BALLOON THAT HAD BEEN RELEASED BUT THEN REALIZED IT WAS REMOTE-CONTROLLED QUADCOPTER-STYLE HELICOPTER DRONE! BASED ON WHAT I KNOW ABOUT THE SIZE OF THEM; I ESTIMATE IT WAS WITHIN 300 TO 500 FEET OF OUR FLIGHT PATH. I SAW IT FIRST AT OUR 2 O'CLOCK LOW POSITION AND IT PASSED SLIGHTLY OFF TO OUR RIGHT WING AND BELOW US. I REPORTED IT IMMEDIATELY TO DEPARTURE AND THEN INFORMED THE CAPTAIN; WHO WAS FLYING THE AIRPLANE BY HAND. HE NEVER SAW IT AND IT HAPPENED MUCH TOO QUICKLY FOR ME TO POINT IT OUT TO HIM. BASED ON MY OBSERVATIONS; THE DRONE WOULD HAVE BEEN FLYING AT A MINIMUM OF 3500 FEET MSL AND POSSIBLY OVER 4000 FEET MSL; WELL IN EXCESS OF WHAT I BELIEVE IS THE AUTHORIZED ALTITUDES . A MID-AIR COLLISION WITH A DRONE COULD CAUSE SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE OR AN ENGINE FAILURE TO A COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. THE SMALL SIZE OF THESE DRONES MAKES THEM PARTICULARLY HAZARDOUS. IN MY OPINION; THEY COULD BE COMPARABLE TO THE THREAT FROM A LARGE BIRD STRIKE; ONLY POTENTIALLY MUCH; MUCH SERIOUS. NOT ONLY ARE THEY NOT EQUIPPED WITH TRANSPONDERS BUT BY THE TIME A PILOT ACQUIRES THEM VISUALLY IT IS LIKELY TOO LATE TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION. AND I IMAGINE THE IMPACT FROM ONE WOULD BE MUCH WORSE THAN THAT WITH A BIRD BASED ON THE MATERIALS USED IN THEIR CONSTRUCTION.THE THREAT TO COMMERCIAL OPERATIONS FROM RECREATIONAL DRONES MUST CONTINUE TO BE ADDRESSED BY THE FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION; NOT ONLY WITH CHANGES IN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS BUT IN VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST VIOLATORS. HISTORICALLY; THE COMMUNITY OF HOBBYISTS WHO OPERATED RADIO-CONTROLLED AIRPLANES ACTED RESPONSIBLY IN STAYING CLEAR OF UNAUTHORIZED AIRSPACE. IN RECENT YEARS; AS DRONES HAVE BECOME MUCH MORE POPULAR; INEXPENSIVE; AND EASY TO OPERATE; IT APPEARS THAT MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE EITHER UNAWARE OF THE RULES OR IRRESPONSIBLE TO THE PRIVILEGES OF OPERATING RC AIRCRAFT HAVE TAKEN UP THE HOBBY. WHEN I SEARCHED ONLINE; I FOUND SOME FOR UNDER $100! AND THEIR PERFORMANCE CAPABILITIES HAVE IMPROVED IN RECENT YEARS SO AS TO MAKE THEM MORE OF A THREAT TO THE OPERATING ENVIRONMENT OF FAA-REGULATED AIRSPACE. 'RECREATIONAL USE OF AIRSPACE BY MODEL AIRCRAFT IS COVERED BY FAA ADVISORY CIRCULAR 91-57; WHICH GENERALLY LIMITS OPERATIONS TO BELOW 400 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL AND AWAY FROM AIRPORTS AND AIR TRAFFIC.' (HTTP://WWW.FAA.GOV/NEWS/FACT_SHEETS/NEWS_STORY.CFM?NEWSID=14153) YET; I DON'T BELIEVE THERE ARE ANY TRAINING; REGISTRATION; OR CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS FOR SOMEONE TO PURCHASE AND OPERATE THESE MODEL AIRCRAFT. CURRENTLY; OPERATORS OF LARGER DRONES FOR COMMERCIAL OR GOVERNMENTAL PURPOSES MAY REGISTER WITH THE FAA TO OPERATE IN EXCESS OF 400 FEET; BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT THE GENERAL PUBLIC WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO WITHOUT DETECTION OR ENFORCEMENT ACTION UNLESS THE FAA TAKES A MUCH MORE FIRM APPROACH.,A B737-NG First Officer reported sighting a UAV within 400 FT of their flight path as they climbed through 4;000-4;500 MSL south and west of DFW on the HRPER1 SID.,2014,11
5,201411,TEXAS,WHILE ON A VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 27 IN IAH MY FIRST OFFICER INFORMED ME HE HAD A DRONE IN SIGHT OFF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. HE STATED THE DRONE LOOKED TO BE YELLOW IN COLOR AND ABOUT 2;500 FEET. OUR CURRENT ALTITUDE DURING THE SIGHTING WAS 3;000 FEET. OUR LOCATION WAS ABOUT 15 DME OF THE ILS AND WE WERE ON THE LOCALIZER TO RUNWAY 27. WE LANDED NORMALLY. WE WERE ADVISED BY DISPATCH TO CONTACT IAH TRACON TO GIVE MORE SPECIFICS OF THE SIGHTING. DRONES ARE A HOT TOPIC ISSUE. THEY ARE INCREASING IN NUMBERS IN THE US. EXTRA VIGILANCE GOING FORWARD TO SEE AND AVOID DRONES IS PARAMOUNT.,EMB145 Captain reports sighting a drone at 2;500 FT on the ILS 27 at IAH. No evasive action is required.,2014,11
6,201411,VIRGINIA,WE WERE ON THE JIIMS2 ARRIVAL INTO PHL DESCENDING THROUGH 17500 FT WITH LNAV/VNAV ENGAGED WITH A CLEARANCE TO CROSS 'RAADS' INTERSECTION AT 15000 FT.  OUR DECENT RATE WAS STANDARD APPROX 2000 FT/MIN 3 DEG.  SUDDENLY TRAFFIC DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US SHOWED ON TCAS. THE CONTROLLER POINTED THE TRAFFIC OUT TO US AND SAID THE TRAFFIC JUST APPEARED TO DO A 360.  I STARTED TO SHALLOW THE DESCENT SINCE THE TRAFFIC WAS BELOW US WHEN THE CONTROLLER ASSIGNED US A HEADING OF 360 FOR TRAFFIC.  LESS THAN A SPLIT SECOND LATER THE TCAS GAVE US A RESOLUTION ADVISORY (RA) WITH A STEEP DESCENT WHICH I COMPLIED WITH IMMEDIATELY AND SIMULTANEOUSLY COMPLIED WITH THE NEW HEADING ASSIGNMENT GIVEN BY THE CONTROLLER. ONCE WE HEARD THE 'CLEAR OF CONFLICT' WE ADVISED THE CONTROLLER AND HE CLEARED US DIRECT TO JIIMS INTERSECTION.  WE NEVER WENT BELOW OUR CROSSING ALTITUDE GIVEN OF 15000 FT DURING THE TRAFFIC ADVISORY (TA)/RA DESCENT FOR THIS TRAFFIC WHICH WE NEVER SAW BUT COULD HAVE BEEN A DRONE SINCE MANEUVERING AT AN ALTITUDE OF APPROX 17;500 FT DOES NOT MAKE ANY SENSE AND THE CONTROLLER WAS NOT IN CONTACT WITH THIS TRAFFIC.,Pilot describes a situation where they are in a descent and get a RA at the same time the Controller issues traffic.  They descend as the RA suggests and turn to a heading issued by the Controller.  Traffic is not seen but suggested to be a drone by the pilot.,2014,11
7,201411,VIRGINIA,I WAS MAKING MY APPROACH TO EZF IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN ON AN EXTENDED DOWNWIND TO BASE LEG TURN IN THE LEFT TRAFFIC PATTERN FOR RUNWAY 24; A UAV WAS OBSERVED MANEUVERING WITHIN ROUGHLY 75 FEET OF THE PILOT SIDE OF MY AIRCRAFT AT THE SAME ALTITUDE. MY POSITION RELATIVE TO THE RUNWAY WAS 2 MILES EAST OF THE APPROACH END OF RUNWAY 24 AT EZF AND 1;100 FT AGL. THE UAV APPEARED TO BE RED; WHITE; AND BLACK IN COLOR TO RESEMBLE A MODEL AIRPLANE WITH A WINGSPAN OF ROUGHLY 3-4 FEET. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN ON MY PART AS THE OPERATOR OF MY AIRCRAFT AND THE FLIGHT WAS CONCLUDED SAFELY. THERE WAS NO WARNING BY MEANS OF RADIO TRANSMISSION; NOTAM; ADS-B SIGNATURE; ETC. OF THE OPERATION OF THIS UAV; AND I WOULD DEEM IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO SPOT VISUALLY UNTIL WITHIN ROUGHLY 200 FT OF THE AIRBORNE UAV.,C182 pilot reports a NMAC with a model aircraft at 1;100 FT 2 NM east of EZF while turning from downwind to base for Runway 24. No evasive action is taken and a normal landing ensues.,2014,11
8,201412,CALIFORNIA,IN REGARDS TO THE ILS 12 @ OAK DATED 18JUL14; THE MORSE CODE THAT REPRESENTS THE ALPHA/NUMERIC CHARACTERS THAT IDENTIFY THE APPROACH IN THE ILS FACILITY BOX IS NOT PRINTED. BE PREPARED TO LOCATE AND USE A MORSE CODE CHART TO IDENTIFY THE APPROACH.  OAK ATIS:  06007KT 10SM -RA FEW008 SCT44 OVC100 13/12 A2984 (TWO NINER EIGHT FOUR). ISL  APPROACHES RUNWAY ONE TWO; RNAV GPS APPROACHES RUNWAY ONE ZERO LEFT. FLOW TO LAX. RWY 10R CLSD. CAUTION; BIRDS NEAR AIRPORT. ...ADVS YOU HAVE INFO. HAVE MORSE CODE DATA PRINTED IN THE ILS FACILITY BOX ON JEPPESEN APPROACH PLATE FOR ILS 12 @  OAK DATED 18JUL14 THE WAY IT IS FOR FOR ALL ILS APPROACH PLATE FACILITY BOXES.,Air Carrier crew report that the frequency box on Jeppesen approach plate for the ILS 12 at OAK lacks the morse code for the identifier (IAAZ).,2014,12
9,201412,COLORADO,I WAS WORKING THE DR CONTROL POSITION. AIRCRAFT X WAS VFR IN THE EAST PRACTICE AREA. I HEARD AIRCRAFT Y CALL INBOUND FOR COS. THINKING IT WAS AIRCRAFT X IN THE EAST PRACTICE AREA I TOLD THE AIRCRAFT TO ENTER A LEFT BASE RUNWAY 17R AND ADVISE THE CURRENT ATIS. AFTER SUBSEQUENT TRANSMISSIONS WITH OTHER AIRCRAFT I NOTICED AIRCRAFT X DID NOT APPEAR TO BE INBOUND. JUST AS I WAS ABOUT TO ASK WHY; AIRCRAFT Y ASKED FOR THE GPS RUNWAY 17R FROM HIDAN. I ASSUMED THAT AIRCRAFT X CHANGED HIS MIND AND DECIDED THEY WANTED THE GPS APPROACH AND THEN THE FULL STOP ON RUNWAY 17R. I TOLD THE AIRCRAFT TO PROCEED TO HIDAN. SOMETIME LATER AIRCRAFT Y ASKED ME IF HE SHOULD SWITCH TO TOWER. I SAID NEGATIVE; I THOUGHT YOU WANTED TO GO TO HIDAN FIRST (AIRCRAFT X WAS ABOUT 15 MILES NE OF COS NORTHBOUND). AIRCRAFT Y SAID NEGATIVE HE WAS TOLD TO ENTER AND WAS NOW ON A LEFT BASE TO RUNWAY 17R. IT WAS AT THIS TIME I REALIZED I WAS TALKING TO TWO AIRCRAFT AND ONLY KNEW ABOUT ONE. I ASKED FOR THE FULL CALLSIGN OF THE AIRCRAFT ON BASE AND WAS TOLD AIRCRAFT Y. I ASKED MY AIRCRAFT GOING TO HIDAN TO SAY FULL CALLSIGN AND WAS TOLD AIRCRAFT X. I NOTICED A V TAG IN TOWER'S AIRSPACE AND ASKED DRA TO GIVE TOWER A HEADS UP ON WHAT WAS GOING ON. I PUT IN A NEW CODE FOR AIRCRAFT Y AND ASKED TO THEM TO IDENT. SURE ENOUGH THEY WERE ALREADY IN TOWER'S AIRSPACE AND STARTING TO TURN FINAL FOR RUNWAY 17R. THERE IS A PROCEDURE AT COS TO ABBREVIATED CALLSIGNS (ESPECIALLY LOCAL VFR) TO THE LAST THREE DIGITS. THIS IS NOT ALWAYS IDEAL WHEN SIMILAR SOUNDING CALLSIGNS COME INTO PLAY AS I LEARNED THE HARD WAY DURING THIS SESSION. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE TOWER WAS NOT BUSY AND THE MISCOMMUNICATION DID NOT LEAD TO ANY ERRORS OR LOSS OF SEPARATION. BUT I FEEL THE POSSIBILITY FOR A HUGE SAFETY ERROR EXISTS. WHILE TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE TWO DIFFERENT AIRCRAFT I FELL BEHIND WITH SOME OF MY OTHER TRAFFIC. NOT TO MENTION THE AIRCRAFT THAT FLEW INTO TOWER'S AIRSPACE UNIDENTIFIED SQUAWKING VFR AND I HAD NO IDEA UNTIL AFTER THE FACT.I THINK EVERYONE IS AWARE OF THE DANGERS THAT CAN ARISE BECAUSE OF MISCOMMUNICATION AS A RESULT OF SIMILAR SOUNDING CALLSIGNS. AT COS THERE IS AN AIRCRAFT Z AND AN AIRCRAFT A BOTH LOCALLY BASED. WITH THOSE TWO AIRCRAFT WE NEVER ABBREVIATE THEIR CALLSIGNS. OBVIOUSLY THE SAME RULE NEEDS TO APPLY TO AIRCRAFT X AND AIRCRAFT Y. I HAVE SEEN BOTH AIRCRAFT BEFORE AND REMEMBER THINKING THAT SOMETHING ADVERSE COULD HAPPEN IF CONTROLLERS ABBREVIATE EITHER CALLSIGN. I WOULD TAKE IT ONE STEP FURTHER AND QUESTION THE SAFETY RAMIFICATIONS OF USING ABBREVIATED CALL SIGNS AT ALL. IT WAS SERIOUSLY DISTURBING FOR ME TO REALIZE THAT I LET AN AIRCRAFT GO UNIDENTIFIED INTO TOWER'S AIRSPACE AND I HAD NO IDEA UNTIL IT WAS TOO LATE.,COS Approach Controller describes a situation where two aircraft have the last three numbers/letter and the confusion it caused her.,2014,12
10,201412,FLORIDA,IN CRUISE FLIGHT WHILE SCANNING FOR TRAFFIC AND BIRDS; I NOTICED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A QUAD COPTER UAV IN LEVEL FLIGHT; SLIGHTLY BELOW MY ALTITUDE AT THE 2 O'CLOCK POSITION GOING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. IT PASSED OFF OUR RIGHT WING. COORDINATES OF THE ENCOUNTER WERE:  28.40 DEGREES NORTH; AND 80.68 DEGREES WEST; OVER MERRITT ISLAND FLORIDA.  THE LOCATION IS CLOSE TO A BUSY GA AIRPORT; COI; AND JUST SOUTH OF THE KENNEDY SPACE CENTER RESTRICTED AREA; CLOSE TO PORT CANAVERAL WITH CRUISE SHIP OPERATIONS. CLEARLY AN ILLEGAL AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS OPERATION IN THE AIRSPACE WITH IMPLICATIONS FOR SAFETY AS WELL AS PORT SECURITY AND NATIONAL SECURITY.,A pilot reports a quadcopter UAV at 1;500 feet just south of the Kennedy Space center restricted area; near COI airport.,2014,12
11,201412,LOUISIANA,ON BASE TO FINAL TURN TO RUNWAY 1 IN MSY AT APPROXIMATELY 1;000 FEET AGL; WE PASSED WITHIN 100 YARDS (ESTIMATED) OF AN UNMANNED AERIAL DRONE.  THE DRONE WAS HEADED WEST AT OUR ALTITUDE AND MADE A QUICK TURN TO THE SOUTH TO AVOID US.  THE DRONE WAS A FIXED WING; SINGLE PROPELLER TYPE COMMERCIAL UNIT. IT PASSED OFF OUR RIGHT WING.  I WAS THE NON PILOT FLYING IN THE LEFT SEAT.  MY FIRST OFFICER WAS FOCUSED ON AVOIDING A HELICOPTER THAT HAD BEEN POINTED OUT TO US; SO SHE DIDN'T GET AS GOOD OF A LOOK AT THE DRONE AS I DID.  SHE DID; HOWEVER; GET A GOOD ENOUGH LOOK AT IT TO DETERMINE THAT IT WAS IN FACT AN AIRCRAFT.  WE DID NOT TAKE EVASIVE ACTION BECAUSE THE ENCOUNTER HAPPENED SO FAST I INITIALLY WASN'T SURE WHAT WE HAD SEEN.  HOWEVER; AFTER TAKING A CLOSER LOOK OUT THE RIGHT WINDOW; I WAS ABLE TO DETERMINE THE DRONE WAS HEADED AWAY FROM US AND WOULD BE NO FACTOR.  I REPORTED THIS DRONE ENCOUNTER TO MSY TOWER; AND SUBSEQUENTLY FOLLOWED UP WITH A PHONE CALL TO THE TRACON AFTER LANDING TO RELAY THE SPECIFICS. INCREASE AWARENESS OF THOSE WHO OPERATE DRONE AIRCRAFT IN THE VICINITY OF COMMERCIAL AIRPORTS AS TO AIRSPACE REGULATIONS AND POSSIBLE COLLISION HAZARDS WITH COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.  FAA NEEDS TO TAKE ACTION TO REGULATE DRONE OPERATIONS; ESPECIALLY WITHIN CONTROLLED AIRSPACE.,Captain reports sighting of a drone at 1;000 feet during approach to Runway 1 at MSY. No evasive action is taken by the reporter; but the drone appears to turn away.,2014,12
12,201412,MINNESOTA,MANAGEMENT ALLOWED A SCHEDULED UNMANNED BALLOON LAUNCH FROM AMW.  POOR COORDINATION WITH AFFECTED SECTORS AND OTHER ADJACENT FACILITIES COULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCIDENT WITH BALLOON CLIMBING THROUGH THE PCA.  CONTROLLERS; INCLUDING MYSELF; WORKING AFFECTED SECTORS HAD LITTLE TO NO INFORMATION AS TO WHEN THE BALLOON LAUNCHED; ITS CURRENT POSITION; OR ALTITUDE AS IT LEFT THE SURFACE TO CLIMB TO 100;000 FT.  THE BALLOON WAS LARGE; 44 FT IN DIAMETER; AND HAD A FAIRLY LARGE PAYLOAD AND HAD NO EQUIPMENT ON BOARD TO HELP WITH TRACKING ITS POSITION OR ALTITUDE.  MANAGEMENT MADE ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT THE POC OF THE BALLON LAUNCH TO GET UPDATES; HOWEVER POC FAILED TO ANSWER PHONE CALLS.  AS THE CONTROLLER WORKING THE AFFECTED HIGH ALTITUDE SECTORS I HAD TO GIVE NUMEROUS AIRCRAFT VAGUE POSITION AND ALTITUDE REPORTS IN REGARDS TO THE BALLOON.  ALTHOUGH NO AIRCRAFT HAD TO DEVIATE FOR THE BALLOON THE SAME SCENERIO COULD BRING A DIFFERENT RESULT NEXT TIME.I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO ALLOW UNMANNED; UNTRANSPONDERED; BALLOONS TO ENTER THE PCA; HOWEVER THESE EVENTS NEED TO HAVE A LARGER SCOPE OF AIRSPACE PROTECTION.  WE WERE ALLOWING AIRCRAFT TO TRAVERSE AN AREA WHERE WE KNEW THE BALLOON WOULD BE AND DID NOTHING TO TRY AND AVOID AN INCIDENT.  WE ALSO NEED TO ESTABLISH BETTER LINES OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE GROUPS PERFORMING THESE ACTIVITIES WHILE THEY ARE ONGOING.  THE POC INVOLVED IN THIS REPORT HAD TO ABILITY TO GIVE US LAT/LONG AND ALTITUDE REPORTS; HOWEVER SINCE WE WERE UNABLE TO GET IN CONTACT WITH HIM AFTER AN INITIAL PHONE CALL THIS INFORMATION WAS UNRETRIEVABLE BY ATC.,ZMP Controller describes a problem with an unmanned balloon that departs from an airport; since the Controller has no idea where it is to be able to give traffic advisories.,2014,12
13,201412,NEW MEXICO,DUE TO POOR STAFFING WE HAD SECTOR 46 COMBINED OVER AT R42. I AM HERE ON YET ANOTHER OVERTIME SHIFT AND EVEN WITH ME AND ANOTHER OVERTIME WE ARE STILL BELOW NUMBERS. SO THERE IS AN ISSUE RIGHT THERE BUT NOT THE ONE WE ARE HERE FOR. SO I AM WORKING R42 WITH 46 COMBINED. I AM AWARE THAT WE HAVE AN UAV RETURNING. I HAVE ALREADY BEEN LOOKING FOR HIM AND HAVE SEEN HIS CODE AND STARTED THE TRACK FOR HIM WHEN HE CALLS CENTER. I TELL HIM TO GO AHEAD AND HE SAYS HE IS GIVING US A RADIO CHECK 7 MIN SOUTH OF VYLLA. I GIVE HIM HIS CODE AND HAVE HIM IDENT AND RADAR IDENTIFY HIM 30 MILES SOUTH OF VYLLA. HE IS LEVEL AT FL210. I GO ABOUT WORK AND HAVE THE SUPERVISOR CALL THE INBOUND SINCE I AM BUSY WITH TWO SECTORS AND TWO FREQUENCIES; SO I'M ALREADY DEALING WITH FREQUENCY CONGESTION WITH THE TWO SECTORS FREQUENCIES. I NOW HAVE A BE20 CALL ME SOUTH OF VYLLA AND I RADAR IDENTIFY HIM LEVEL AT FL200. UNEXPECTEDLY; THE UAV STARTS DESCENDING. HE IS STILL SOUTH OF VYLLA AND ABOUT 4 MILES EAST OF THE BE20. SO SEPARATION IS ALREADY LOST. I CALL THE UAV AND TELL HIM TO CLIMB TO FL210. HE DOESN'T RESPOND AND CONTINUES DESCENT. I CALL AGAIN AND HE FINALLY ANSWERS AND I CLEAR HIM BACK TO FL210 AND CALL THE TRAFFIC. HE ACKNOWLEDGES AND SAYS RETURNING TO FL210. I THEN TRY TO ASCERTAIN WHY HE WAS DESCENDING TO FL200. HE RESPONDS BY SAYING HE HAS JUST LEVELED AT FL200 AFTER I HAD CLEARED HIM AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED THE CLIMB TO FL210! I AGAIN TELL HIM TO CLIMB AND MAINTAIN FL210 AND I ALSO TURNED HIM 20 RIGHT SINCE HE AND THE BE20 WERE BOTH CONVERGING AT VYLLA AND SINCE HE CLEARLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND MY CLEARANCE TO FL210. HE AGAIN ACKNOWLEDGES THE CLIMB AND TURN AND FINALLY STARTS THE CLIMB. AS SOON AS THE BE20 ENTERS MY AIRSPACE I DESCEND HIM TO FL180. I KEEP TRYING TO GET THE UAV PILOT TO GIVE ME HIS REASON FOR HIS DESCENT AND I FINALLY GET THAT THEY HAD JUST MADE A 'PILOT SWAP' AND THAT THE LOA STATES THEY CROSS INTO US AIRSPACE AT FL200 SO HE JUST DESCENDED TO FL200. I ASK IF THE CONTROLLER HAD ISSUED THAT CROSSING INSTRUCTION AND HE SAYS NEGATIVE IT IS IN THE LOA. I ADVISED HIM THE LOA DOESN'T SUPERSEDE ATC CLEARANCES AND HE CANNOT DESCEND WITHOUT A CLEARANCE FROM ATC. IF WE ARE EXPECTED TO WORK MORE AND MORE UAVS THEN THE PILOTS OF THE UAVS NEED TO BE TRAINED PILOTS IN THE NAS. THEY SHOULD HOLD CURRENT PILOTS LICENSES WITH PROPER RATINGS. THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEY MUST OBEY ALL ATC CLEARANCES AND THAT AN ATC CLEARANCE SUPERSEDES ANY OTHER LOA OR FLIGHT PLAN OR ANYTHING. ALSO UAVS ARE NOTORIOUSLY HARD TO GET A HOLD OF SOMETIMES AND THEY OFTEN GO NORDO FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THEIR RADIOS ARE POOR AND TRANSMISSIONS ARE HARD TO UNDERSTAND MUCH OF THE TIME. IF THIS UAV HADN'T FINALLY RESPONDED TO ME HE COULD HAVE BEEN OVER VYLLA AT FL200 AT THE SAME TIME AS THE BE20. OF COURSE I WOULD HAVE TRIED TO MOVE THE BE20 BUT WHEN DEALING WITH FOREIGN ATC SOMETIMES THEY GET LOST IN THE TRANSFER AND THEY DON'T SHIP AIRCRAFT UNTIL THEY ARE OVER VYLLA. THIS COULD HAVE BEEN WORSE THAN A LOSS OF SEPARATION. I FEEL THAT WE NEED TO RELOOK AT UAVS IN THE NAS. ARE THEY SAFE? ARE THE PILOTS PROPERLY TRAINED AND DO THEY UNDERSTAND HOW THINGS OPERATE IN THE NAS?,ZAB Controller reports a UAV descending without clearance; causing loss of separation with a BE20. The UAV pilot stated he was descending in compliance with the LOA. The reporter believes that UAV pilots should have licenses and be properly trained to fly an IFR clearance in the NAS.,2014,12
14,201501,CALIFORNIA,I WAS ON SHORT FINAL FOR RWY 30; WINDS REPORTED ~ 7-8 KNOTS FROM 280. I WAS SLIGHTLY HIGH ON GLIDE PATH; SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF CENTERLINE. A BLACK DRONE CAME FLYING ON A RECIPROCAL TRACK; JUST BELOW ME AND SLIGHTLY TO MY LEFT. THE DRONE WAS BLACK; WITH A SMALL LIGHT ON THE FRONT. BECAUSE OF THE HIGH CLOSING SPEED AND LOW-VIS OF THE DRONE; IT WAS PAST ME (HEADED TOWARD BUR CLASS C AIRSPACE!) BEFORE I COULD TAKE ANY ACTION OR EVEN DECIDE WHETHER ANY WAS NEEDED. I REPORTED THE NEAR-MISS TO WHP TOWER AND DO NOT KNOW WHAT IF ANY ACTION WAS TAKEN BY TWR. AIRPORT WAS BUSY AND ONE CONTROLLER HANDLING BOTH GROUND AND AIR TRAFFIC. I BELIEVE THAT IF I'D BEEN EXACTLY ON GLIDESLOPE AND EXACTLY ON CENTERLINE A MIDAIR WOULD HAVE BEEN LIKELY. THE MIDAIR WAS PREVENTED BY MY BEING SLIGHTLY ABOVE GLIDEPATH AND SLIGHTLY RIGHT (IN THE PROCESS OF CORRECTING TO CENTERLINE). NO COMMENTS ON PREVENTION. NO ABILITY TO AVOID; TARGET WAS TOO SMALL AND LOW-VISIBILITY. AS TO HITTING A DRONE; BEING SLIGHTLY HIGH ON FINAL (RATHER THAN THE COMMON PRACTICE OF 'DRAGGING IT IN') MEANS THAT IF A COLLISION MADE ME DEADSTICK I COULD STILL EASILY MAKE THE RUNWAY. I WOULD ALSO COMMENT THAT I 'FLY THE PLANE'; IT IS MORE IMPORTANT TO MAKE THE LANDING… MIDAIR OR NEAR-MISS… THAN TO GET DISTRACTED TRYING TO TELL THE TOWER THE DETAILS OF WHAT HAPPENED. I BELIEVE THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN OKAY EVEN IF A DRONE MIDAIR KILLED THE ENGINE. I WILL SAY I AM AGHAST AT THE SELFISHNESS AND STUPIDITY OF FLYING A DRONE NOT ONLY IN AIRPORT SPACE; BUT THE 'WRONG WAY' ON FINAL.,PA28 pilot on short final to Runway 30 at WHP experienced a NMAC with a drone flying in the opposite direction.,2015,01
15,201501,MASSACHUSETTS,DESCENDING THROUGH 7000 FEET ON THE QUABN3 RNAV ARRIVAL AN OBJECT PASSED BY THE LEFT SIDE; ABOVE AND WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET OF OUR AIRCRAFT. THE ACM AND I BOTH SAW IT FOR ONLY A SECOND OR LESS. THE OBJECT WAS FOOTBALL SHAPED; RED AND BLUE IN COLOR. IT APPEARED TO BE EITHER A BALLOON OR A DRONE.,B737 Captain reported NMAC with a drone or a balloon on the QUABN3 Arrival into BOS.,2015,01
16,201502,ARIZONA,WHEN FLYING THE ARRIVAL A LARGE DRONE WAS OBSERVED LEFT OF THE PLANE. WE WERE FLYING PERPENDICULAR TOWARDS THE RUNWAY WITH A DISTANCE OF 1.5 MILES TOWARDS THE RUNWAY; JUST BEFORE ENTERING THE LEFT HAND DOWNWIND FOR RUNWAY 03. THE OBSERVER SAW A RED AND BLACK; AT THAT TIME UNIDENTIFIED; OBJECT VERY CLOSE AND 9 O'CLOCK OF THE PLANE AND NOTIFIED THE STUDENT PILOT AND INSTRUCTOR PILOT. THE STUDENT PILOT AND I AGREED THAT IT WAS A DRONE RIGHT AT TRAFFIC PATTERN ALTITUDE.  ATC WAS NOT INFORMED AND APPROACH WAS CONTINUED. LATER ON THE GROUND WE AGREED THE HORIZONTAL DISTANCE WAS AROUND 200 FT.,F33A student pilot sitting in the cabin; with  another student and the instructor at the controls; reports sighting a drone while entering the traffic pattern at GYR.,2015,02
17,201502,CALIFORNIA,WHILE TURNING BASE LEG FOR A VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 24R AT LAX; I SPOTTED A RED OR ORANGE OBJECT PASS CLOSELY OVER THE TOP OF MY (CAPTAIN) WINDSCREEN. I SAW THE OBJECT FOR LESS THAN ONE SECOND; AND IMMEDIATELY THOUGHT IT WAS A MODEL UAV (4-LEGGED CROSS LOOKING). I REPORTED THIS TO SOCAL APPROACH SO THEY COULD PASS ADVISORIES TO PROXIMATE AIRCRAFT. IT ALL HAPPENED SO QUICKLY THAT I CAN'T BE COMPLETELY SURE THE OBJECT WAS A UAV; VERSUS PAPER; BALLOONS; ETC. HOWEVER; I DO REMEMBER THE OBJECT BEING SQUARE SHAPED WITH DEFINED LINES; VERSUS IRREGULAR LIKE PAPER OR BALLOONS. THE OBJECT WAS DEFINITELY RED OR ORANGE IN COLOR. I FAILED TO REPORT THIS SOONER; BECAUSE IT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY; AND WE WERE INVOLVED IN OUR APPROACH; SO AFTER IT HAPPENED; IT COMPLETELY SLIPPED MY MIND.  THIS OBJECT WAS SO SMALL IT COULD NOT BE SEEN IN TIME FOR EVASION. IF IT WAS A UAV; IT SHOULDN'T BE FLOWN THAT HIGH NEAR A MAJOR AIRPORT.,B737-700 Captain reports sighting a small UAV at 4;000 feet during a visual approach to Runway 24R at LAX.,2015,02
18,201502,CALIFORNIA,QUAD COPTER DRONE PASSED INSIDE 50 FEET OF RIGHT WING WHILE WE WERE LIMPING OUT OF SJC AT 11;000 FEET 8 MILES SOUTHEAST TURNING NORTH.WE NEED MORE EFFECTIVE DRONE RESTRICTIONS.,Flight crew climbing out of SJC suffered an NMAC with a large four rotor UAV drone.,2015,02
19,201502,CALIFORNIA,I WAS PROVIDING VFR VECTORS TO A CESSNA FOR A PRACTICE INSTRUMENT APPROACH. THE FLIGHT WAS ON A SOUTH DOWNWIND TO CRQ WHEN THE PILOT REPORTED THAT AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE WITH A RED LIGHT CAME WITHIN 50 FEET OF HIS POSITION. REGULATE UAV USAGE AND PROSECUTE VIOLATORS.,SCT Controller reported a conflict between a Cessna 172 pilot and an unmanned aerial vehicle within 50 feet of their aircraft while on a south downwind to CRQ.,2015,02
20,201502,CALIFORNIA,I WAS AIRCRAFT NUMBER 1 OF 3 IN THE PATTERN. WE WERE PRACTICING SHORT-FIELD LANDINGS AT NEW JERUSALEM AIRPORT. SINCE THIS IS AN UNCONTROLLED AIRPORT; I ANNOUNCED ON CTAF 122.90 EACH TURN IN THE PATTERN. AS I TURNED CROSSWIND TO DOWNWIND; I IMMEDIATELY SAW ANOTHER AIRCRAFT THAT CAME HEAD FIRST AT ME. I TOOK EVASIVE ACTION AND INITIATED A CLIMB; I WAS STILL CLIMBING TO TPA BUT DECIDED TO CLIMB TO 1;500. THIS IDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT WAS A BLUE AND WHITE CESSNA 172. I WAS STILL CLIMBING TO 900 CLIMBING TO TPA.WINDS FAVORED RUNWAY 30 AND EACH OF THE AIRCRAFT IN THE PATTERN SAID THEIR POSITIONS. I TOOK OVER AND SAID; 'UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT IN NEW JEW TRAFFIC RESPOND.' WE HEARD NO REPLY. MY CO-PILOT; A CFI; AND I HAD POSITIVE EXCHANGE OF CONTROLS. WE CONTINUED TO MONITOR THIS AIRCRAFT AND REPORTED TO THE OTHER PLANES HIS ACTIVITY. THIS AIRCRAFT WAS CLOSE TO THE POINT WHERE I SAW HIS BELLY; NOT ABLE TO GET A TAIL NUMBER YET. FRIENDS ON THE GROUND GOT A SIDE GLIMPSE OF HIS TAIL NUMBER AND WILL HOPEFULLY GET IT SOON. THE OTHER AIRCRAFT CAME IN AND MADE A BAD LANDING OFF CENTER TOWARDS THE LEFT. WE MONITORED HIM UNTIL HE LEFT A TOUCH-N-GO AND HEADED NORTH WEST ON A HEADING OF ROUGHLY 285.AS PIC I DID WHAT I BELIEVED WAS THE CORRECT FORM OF ACTION. I UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS UNCONTROLLED; BUT TO COME IN AND DISREGARD ALL OTHER TRAFFIC IN THE PATTERN SHOWS A SLOPPY PILOT AND A HAZARD TO OTHER AIRMEN.,C152 pilot reported an NMAC in the pattern at 1Q4.,2015,02
21,201502,CALIFORNIA,WE WERE ON THE ILS 25L COMING INTO LAX ON AN UNUSUALLY CLEAR DAY WITH EXCELLENT VISIBILITY AND NONE OF THE USUAL LA HAZE. THE CAPTAIN (CA) WAS PILOT FLYING (PF) AND I WAS PILOT MONITORING (PM). WE HAD JUST PASSED HUNDA BY APPROXIMATELY 1 TO 1.5 MILES AND WERE ABOUT TO DESCEND THROUGH AN ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 3;000 FEET. I WAS JUST ABOUT TO CONTACT TOWER AFTER BEING HANDED OFF BY APPROACH WHEN SOMETHING CAUGHT MY EYE SLIGHTLY AHEAD AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A LARGE BIRD SOARING TOWARDS US; BUT AS IT PASSED OUTSIDE OF THE RIGHT FORWARD FIRST OFFICER'S (FO) WINDOW; I VERY CLEARLY SAW A LARGE SQUARE-SHAPED BRIGHT RED DRONE WITH BLACK ACCENTS AND BLACK PROPELLERS. I HAD IT IN SIGHT FOR APPROXIMATELY 3 SECONDS AS IT APPROACHED AND PASSED. IT APPEARED TO BE HEADING OPPOSITE OUR DIRECTION AND I WOULD ESTIMATE IT WAS ONLY ABOUT 50 TO 100 FEET HIGHER THAN US WHEN WE WERE PASSING ABEAM IT AND IT WAS PROBABLY ONLY BETWEEN 100 AND 200 FEET RIGHT OF US. IT WAS DEFINITELY CLOSE ENOUGH FOR ME TO VERY CLEARLY SEE IT AND RECOGNIZE WHAT IT WAS; BUT NOT CLOSE ENOUGH THAT I FEARED IT WOULD STRIKE OUR RIGHT WING; ENGINE; OR STABILIZER. IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE PASSED IT; I CHECKED IN WITH TOWER AND REPORTED THAT WE HAD JUST PASSED A DRONE INSIDE OF HUNDA. THE TOWER CONTROLLER ASKED IF AN ESTIMATE OF ABOUT 3;200 FEET ALTITUDE FOR THE DRONE WAS ACCURATE AND I AGREED. A FEW SECONDS LATER HE ASKED APPROXIMATELY HOW FAR AWAY FROM US I THOUGHT IT HAD PASSED AND WHAT COLOR IT WAS; AND I GAVE A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE OF APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET AWAY FROM US AND RED WITH BLACK FOR THE COLOR.I'M NOT SURE THERE IS ANYTHING WE AS PILOTS OR THE TOWER CONTROLLER COULD HAVE DONE TO PREVENT THIS UNCOMFORTABLY CLOSE ENCOUNTER BETWEEN A DRONE AND A LARGE PASSENGER AIRPLANE UNLESS THESE OBJECTS ARE MADE TO BE DETECTABLE ON RADAR AND/OR TCAS AND TRACEABLE TO THEIR EXTRAORDINARILY IRRESPONSIBLE OWNERS/OPERATORS.,A B757 flight crew encountered a UAV on final approach to LAX as they descended through 3;000 feet MSL.,2015,02
22,201502,FLORIDA,I WAS WORKING SECTOR 21/01 BY MYSELF.  IT WAS A VERY SLOW PERIOD.  AIRCRAFT X WHO WAS AT THE TIME DIRECT PERMT CLIMBING TO HIS REQUESTED FINAL ALTITUDE KEYS UP ASKING IF THERE WAS ANY KNOWN DRONE ACTIVITY IN THE AREA.  THE PILOT SOUNDED VERY SHAKEN UP.  I SAID NOT THAT I WAS AWARE OF AND CALLED MY SUPERVISOR OVER TO VERIFY.  MY SUPERVISOR CALLS THE DEN [DOMESTIC EVENT NETWORK] TO CONFIRM AND THE OM CAME DOWN ASKING FOR THE PILOT TO GIVE AS MUCH DETAIL OF THE DRONE AS THE PILOT COULD REMEMBER. AIRCRAFT X INFORMED US THAT HE SAW THE SUSPECTED DRONE WHEN HE WAS CLIMBING OUT OF FL250.  HE SAID THE DRONE WAS SOUTHBOUND; LARGE; AND MOVING RAPIDLY.  AIRCRAFT X ALSO DETERMINED THE DRONE TO BE WHITE WITH WINGS.  THERE WAS NEVER A PRIMARY TARGET OBSERVED ON THE RADAR SCOPE.  I THEN ASKED MY SUPERVISOR WHAT STEPS I SHOULD FOLLOW CONCERNING THE DRONE AND HE SAID NOTHING ELSE WAS REQUIRED.  I DIDN'T FEEL COMFORTABLE WITH THIS AND KNEW THE SECTOR TO THE WEST OF MINE WORKS A LOT OF MIAMI ARRIVAL TRAFFIC DESCENDING IN THAT AREA SO I CALLED TO INFORM THEM AND ALSO CONTINUED TO CALL THE LAST KNOWN POSITION ALTITUDE AND DIRECTION OF FLIGHT OF THE DRONE UNTIL I HAD SEVERAL AIRCRAFT REPORT NOT SEEING IT. WHEN ASKED IF I NEEDED TO FILL OUT ANY REPORTS MY SUPERVISOR TOLD ME NO.  ALSO WHEN I ASKED FOR HOW LONG I SHOULD CALL THE DRONE AND IF THE SUPERVISOR REPORTED IT TO THE CARR AREA SINCE THE DRONE WAS LAST REPORTED SOUTHBOUND AND THAT WOULD BE THE NEXT AREA IT WOULD VIOLATE IF STILL ON THAT HEADING THE SUPERVISOR REPORTED NO SINCE WE DID NOT KNOW WHERE THE DRONE WAS.  IN MY OPINION THAT WOULD BE THE EXACT REASON WHY WE WOULD WANT TO INFORM THE AIRCRAFT AND OTHER CONTROLLERS IN THE VICINITY SO THAT THE PILOTS COULD BE MORE DILIGENT SCANNING THEIR SURROUNDINGS. IT WAS SUSPECTED THAT THE OCCURRENCE WAS MILITARY BASED ON THE ALTITUDE AND POSITION SO FAR FROM LAND OF THE DRONE.  I WASN'T MADE PRIVY IF THAT WAS IN FACT WHAT HAPPENED.  BUT IF SO I HOPE THE MILITARY WOULD BE MORE DILIGENT IN KEEPING US INFORMED OF POSSIBLE DRONE ACTIVITY ESPECIALLY IN A POSITION WHERE WE HAVE DENSE TRAFFIC PERIODS.  ALSO I BELIEVE WE NEED TO HAVE BETTER STANDARD PROCEDURES IN PLACE FOR DEALING WITH AN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT AS FAR AS WHAT THE PILOT NEEDS TO REPORT AND IF WE NEED TO CALL OTHER SECTORS OR INFORM OTHER PILOTS IN THE AREA.,ZMA Controller while working a combined position is asked by a pilot of any known drone activity in the area. Pilot reports to Controller of observing a drone. Controller advises superiors and wonders what to do next.,2015,02
23,201502,GEORGIA,PURCHASED A DJI INSPIRE 1 UAV. MY PREVIOUS EXPERIENCE WITH RADIO CONTROL SYSTEMS WAS WITH CARS IN 1985. EAGER TO TEST FLY THE UAV; I FLEW IT AT MY PARENTS' HOME; NOT REALIZING THAT FTY WAS ACTUALLY LESS THAN FIVE MILES FROM THEIR HOME. DURING THE FLIGHT THE HIGHEST I FLEW THE UAV WAS ABOUT 76 FEET FOR LESS THAN ONE MINUTE. OTHER THAN THAT; TOTAL FLIGHT TIME WAS 15 MINUTES AT AN ALTITUDE RANGING FROM .5 TO 13 FEET. AT NO TIME DID I FLY HIGHER THAN TREE LEVEL OR ENTER CLASS B AIRSPACE. AT NO TIME DID THE FLIGHT INTERFERE WITH PRIVATE OR COMMERCIAL AIR TRAFFIC. AT NO TIME WAS THERE A TRAFFIC CONFLICT.[IN THE FUTURE I WILL] CONDUCT AN AIRPORT RECON AND DISTANCE CHECK PRIOR TO UAV FLIGHT.,An ATP rated pilot purchased a small UAV and inadvertently flew it within five miles of an airport but never at an altitude above 76 feet and; thus; did not consider the operation to have been a hazard to manned aircraft.,2015,02
24,201502,NEW JERSEY,ON THE TAKEOFF ROLL AT 75 KNOTS; I HEARD THE MASTER CAUTION CHIME AND MOVED MY EYES TO THE EICAS.  ON THE SCREEN I READ IN MY HEAD; E2 REV DISAGREE.  BEFORE I COULD VERBALIZE THE MESSAGE; THE CA WHO WAS PF; CALLED AN ABORT.  HE BELIEVES THE SPEED AT ABORT WAS 95 KNOTS.  I RADIOED ATC WE WERE ABORTING TAKEOFF AND MADE A PA FOR THE PASSENGERS TO REMAIN SEATED. THE AIRCRAFT CAME TO A STOP AND THEN WE COORDINATED WITH ATC TO TAXI OFF THE RUNWAY SLOWLY.  ON A TAXIWAY WITH THE PARKING BRAKE SET; THE CA CALLED MAINTENANCE CONTROL AND THEY INSTRUCTED US TO GATE RETURN.  LOCAL MAINTENANCE MEL'D THE E2 THRUST REVERSER AND WE CONTINUED ON TO OUR DESTINATION.  THREAT WAS GUSTY WINDS IN EWR WHICH MAY HAVE SLIGHTLY AFFECTED THE STOWAGE OF THE THRUST REVERSER; CAUSING THE MESSAGE TO GENERATE.  ERROR ON MY PART AS PM WAS NOT VERBALIZING THE MESSAGE IMMEDIATELY; WASTING A FEW FAST MOVING SECONDS.  UAS WAS THE HIGH SPEED ABORTED TAKEOFF.,EMB-145 First Officer reported noting an E2 REV DISAGREE light on takeoff roll at about 95 kts that resulted in a rejected takeoff.,2015,02
25,201503,CALIFORNIA,WHEN I GOT IN AND RELIEVED THE MID-SHIFT I NOTICED 3 HIGH ALTITUDE CODES IN AND CLOSE TO MY AIRSPACE THAT NOBODY NEW ABOUT.  THE CODES HAD VARIOUS ALTITUDES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TARGETS ALL RANGING BETWEEN 520 AND 590 [FL520-590].  WE ASSUMED THEY WERE BAD RADAR TARGETS BUT THE SOC SAID THEY WEREN'T.  WHEN THE MOS GOT IN; WE CONFIRMED THAT THE CODES WERE; IN FACT; HIGH ALTITUDE BALLOONS.  THEY CLAIM THE AREA KNEW ABOUT IT FROM THE NIGHT BEFORE; BUT NOBODY COULD FIND PAPERWORK IN THE AREA.  THEY SAID THEY WOULD BRING DOWN THE PAPERWORK BUT NEVER DID.  I THINK THIS IS A DANGEROUS SITUATION ESPECIALLY WITH THE NUMBER OF HIGH-ALTITUDE GLOBAL HAWKS THAT WE HAVE FLYING AROUND IN THE SAME AIRSPACE.  OVER THE NEXT HOUR OR SO I OBSERVED THE BALLOONS FLOAT INTO ZDV AND ZLC AIRSPACE AND CALLED BOTH OF THOSE OTHER SECTORS TO TELL THEM ABOUT THE CODES.  NEITHER ZDV NOR ZLC KNEW ABOUT THE BALLOONS BEFORE MY CALL EITHER.THE AREAS MUST BE KEPT INFORMED OF BALLOON ACTIVITY ESPECIALLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE FREQUENTLY HAVE HIGH-ALTITUDE GLOBAL HAWK AIRCRAFT IN THE AIRSPACE.,ZLA Controller reports of high altitude balloons in which the sectors didn't have any information on. Traffic Management Unit said they knew about them the night before and should have paperwork in the area.,2015,03
26,201503,CALIFORNIA,I WAS WORKING AS AN OJTI TO MY TRAINEE ON THE DESERT SECTOR. TRAFFIC HAD BEEN BUSY ALL DAY AND MOSTLY COMPLEX; DEFINITELY A BUSY DAY. RUNWAY 13 WAS IN USE AT THE AIRPORT AND VISUAL APPROACHES WERE BEING UTILIZED. AIRCRAFT X WAS AN IFR ON A LEFT DOWNWIND FOR PSP. MY TRAINEE CLEARED AIRCRAFT X FOR A VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 13R LIKE NORMAL. AIRCRAFT X TURNED BASE APPROX. 8 MILES NE OF THE AIRPORT AND WAS DESCENDING. MULTIPLE OTHER THINGS WERE GOING ON AROUND THE AIRSPACE FORCING BOTH THE TRAINEE AND I TO KEEP OUR SCANS GOING ALL AROUND THE AIRSPACE. MY TRAINEE PICKED UP A TARGET EXITING THE BANNING PASS (MOUNTAIN PASS APPROX. 15 MILES WEST OF PSP) LOW LEVEL (I BELIEVE AT 4;000 FEET IN A SLOW DESCENT) AND ISSUED TRAFFIC TO AIRCRAFT X.  AIRCRAFT X ACKNOWLEDGED THE TRAFFIC. ONLY A FEW SECONDS WENT BY BEFORE I STEPPED IN AND ISSUED A TRAFFIC ALERT TO AIRCRAFT X AND TOLD THEM TO MAINTAIN 4;000 FEET. AT THE TIME I ISSUED THE TRAFFIC ALERT; THE RADAR SHOWED AIRCRAFT X AT 4;100 FEET AND THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGET AT 3;500 FEET. AIRCRAFT X RESPONDED 'WE'RE ALREADY THROUGH 4;000 FEET '. I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT TIME THAT AIRCRAFT Y CALLED US FOR ADVISORIES; BUT HE SAID WHERE HE WAS AND HIS ALTITUDE; AND I IMMEDIATELY KNEW THAT THE TARGET WAS HIM. AIRCRAFT X SAID 'WE'RE DESCENDING'. I BELIEVE I SAID 'AIRCRAFT Y ON FREQUENCY DESCEND TO 2;500 FEET IMMEDIATELY; DO YOU HAVE THE AIRCRAFT AT 11 O'CLOCK AND A HALF MILE IN SIGHT?' I RECEIVED NO RESPONSE; BUT I OBSERVED THE TARGET DESCENDING RAPIDLY. I RECEIVED NO WORD FROM AIRCRAFT X ON IF THEY WERE RESPONDING TO AN RA; WHICH IS WHY I CONTINUED TO TRY AND RESOLVE THE SITUATION. AT THIS TIME; BOTH AIRCRAFT WERE IN RAPID DESCENTS TO TRY AND AVOID EACH OTHER; ONE LISTENING TO MY RECOMMENDATION; AND THE OTHER NOT. I FOUND OUT LATER THAT AIRCRAFT X HAD RESPONDED TO THREE RAS; BUT DID NOT ADVISE ME; WHICH TO ME IS UNDERSTANDABLE GIVEN THE ALTITUDE AND THE PROXIMITY. I OBSERVED BOTH TARGETS MERGE; ONE SHOWED 2;200 AND ONE SHOWED 2;300.AIRCRAFT X FINALLY CAME BACK AND SAID 'OK; WE GOT HIM NOW; HE'S RIGHT OVER THE TOP OF US'. THE PILOT FOR AIRCRAFT X SAID THEY WOULD LIKE TO BE RE-SEQUENCED FOR AN APPROACH IN WHICH I COMPLIED. I TOOK OVER FOR THE TRAINEE UNTIL AIRCRAFT X WAS SWITCHED TO THE TOWER. RADAR COVERAGE IN THE BANNING PASS IS NON-EXISTENT BELOW 6;000 FEET. WE CAN PICK UP AIRCRAFT AROUND THE PASS IF THEY ARE AT 5;500 TO 5;000 FEET; BUT THEY USUALLY ARE INTERMITTENT HITS. AT 4;500 FEET AND BELOW; OUR RADAR WILL ONLY PICK THEM UP ONCE THEY ARE AT THE INTERSECTION OF INTERSTATE 10 AND HIGHWAY 111. THIS INTERSECTION IS ABSOLUTELY IN THE ARRIVAL CORRIDOR FOR PSP WHEN THEY ARE LANDING 13R. IT'S ALSO RIGHT IN THE DEPARTURE CORRIDOR FOR 31L. THIS IS ABOUT HERE WE PICKED UP AIRCRAFT Y ON RADAR. HOWEVER; WHEN WE ARE WORKING OTHER AIRCRAFT; OUR SCAN CANNOT BE ON ONE SPOT 100% OF THE TIME.  THE TRAINEE PICKED UP THE TARGET IN TIME TO ISSUE TRAFFIC; BUT HIS LACK OF EXPERIENCE LED TO HIM NOT GIVING A TRAFFIC ALERT RIGHT AWAY; WHICH IS WHY I STEPPED IN. AIRCRAFT Y DID NOT CALL US FOR ADVISORIES WHEN IN THE PASS; WHERE WE COULD HAVE GIVEN HIM INSTRUCTIONS TO REMAIN CLEAR OF THE ARRIVAL CORRIDOR; AND BY THE TIME HE CALLED; THE SCENARIO WAS ALREADY HAPPENING.  THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR AIRCRAFT Y TO CALL. AIRCRAFT Y WAS MORE THAN LEGAL BEING WHERE HE WAS; EVEN THOUGH HE WAS IN THE TRSA; PARTICIPATION IS ENTIRELY OPTIONAL ON THE PART OF THE PILOT. PSP IS A SLOW AIRPORT IN THE SUMMER TIME; BUT A VERY BUSY AIRPORT; NOT JUST FOR IFR'S; IN THE WINTER. MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO CREATE A CLASS C AIRSPACE AROUND THE PSP AIRPORT THAT WOULD PROTECT THESE AIRCRAFT FROM VFR PILOTS TRANSITIONING THROUGH THEIR AREA. PROTECT THE ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE CORRIDORS FOR THESE AIRCRAFT WHO DO NOT HAVE MUCH ROOM TO MANEUVER DUE TO TERRAIN. THE TRSA AROUND THE AIRPORT DOES ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO PROMOTE SAFETY AND PROTECT THE AIRCRAFT TRYING TO TAKE OFF AND LAND AT PSP. THIS MAY BE MY FIRST REPORT ON THE ISSUE; BUTIT IS DEFINITELY NOT THE FIRST TIME A TARGET HAS APPEARED FROM BANNING AND CONVERGED WITH AN AIRCRAFT ATTEMPTING TO LAND AT PSP. I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY OTHER REPORTS HAVE BEEN FILED FOR THIS PROBLEM; BUT IT IS ABSOLUTELY A DANGEROUS SITUATION.,Four reports from an SCT Controller providing training; his trainee Controller and the crew of an airline aircraft documenting a near mid-air caused by an aircraft coming out of the Banning Pass and conflicting with the airliner turning final for PSP.,2015,03
27,201503,CALIFORNIA,POSSIBLE NMAC IN OWENS VALLEY NEAR OLANCHA; CA. F/A-18F OPERATING LOW LEVEL; HEADING NORTHBOUND. APPROXIMATELY 450 KCAS (KNOTS CALIBRATED AIRSPEED). OBJECT OBSERVED CLOSE OVER CANOPY. NOT IDENTIFIABLE. POSSIBLE LARGE BIRD OR SMALL AIRCRAFT. NO ONBOARD RADAR TRACKS OR ADVISORY CALLS NOTED.,F/A 18 pilot experiences a NMAC with a large bird or small aircraft over the Owens Valley in California; during a low level training exercise.,2015,03
28,201503,FLORIDA,AFTER DEPARTING KEY WEST AND SOME MULTIPLE VECTORS WE WERE TOLD TO TURN 'DIRECT CARNU AND CONTACT MIAMI CENTER'AFTER TURNING DIRECT TO CARNU MY FIRST OFFICER COULD SEE THAT IT WAS TAKING US DIRECTLY TOWARDS THE WEATHER BALLOON/RESTRICTED AIRSPACE; MY VIEW WAS TEMPORARILY BLOCKED DUE TO THE WINDOW SPAR. AFTER ROLLING OUT I COULD SEE IT AS WELL AND CONCURRED. WE HAD THE VISUAL AND WERE ABOVE THE BALLOON. I IMMEDIATELY TRIED TO CONTACT MIAMI CENTER BUT THE CONTROLLER WAS VERY BUSY; AT ABOUT THE EXACT TIME MY FO INITIATED A TURN TO THE RIGHT; WE ALSO GOT THE EGPWS WARNING 'OBSTACLE; OBSTACLE; PULL UP.' WE FOLLOWED THE EGPWS AND INITIATED A TURN. RIGHT AFTER IMITATING THE CLIMBING/TURN I WAS ABLE TO CONTACT MIAMI CENTER AND TOLD THEM WHAT WAS GOING ON. THEY TURNED US 20 DEGREES RIGHT; FOLLOWED BY AN ADDITIONAL 10 DEGREES RIGHT. WE IMMEDIATELY COMPLIED AND RETURNED TO ASSIGNED ALTITUDE. WE WERE ASSIGNED 9;000 FT AND CLIMBED TO 9;500 FT TO COMPLY WITH THE EGPWS WARNING. KEY WEST DEPARTURE SHOULD NOT TURN US DIRECTLY TOWARD A RESTRICTED AIRSPACE.,EYW Departure turned an aircraft toward R-2916 at 9;000 FT so the crew took evasive action as the EGPWS alerted Obstacle; Obstacle; Pull UP.,2015,03
29,201503,NORTH CAROLINA,AROUND 1100 [FEET] MY STUDENT AND I WERE FLYING SOUTH OF BUCKHORN LAKE AND WEST OF JNX PRACTICING MANEUVERS; WHEN I NOTICED A MOVING OBJECT AT MY 1 O'CLOCK. IT WAS PRETTY CLOSE TO ME ON MY RIGHT AT ABOUT THE SAME ALTITUDE (3;500 FT). THE DRONE WAS HEADING NORTH BOUND TOWARDS BUCKHORN LAKE; AT A FAST SPEED. THE COLOR OF THE DRONE WAS RED AND IT LOOKED LIKE IT HAD 4 SMALL ROTORS AND THAT IS ALL I COULD DETECT. I MADE A CALL ON THE JOHNSTON COUNTY UNICOM ABOUT THE DRONE AND PLANES IN THE AREA EVACUATED. AS SOON I LANDED I CALLED RALEIGH APPROACH ON THE TELEPHONE AND MADE THE REPORT.,A flight instructor and his student encountered a UAV/Drone while practicing training maneuvers. They announced its presence on a local CTAF and; along with other aircraft in the practice area; departed as a precaution.,2015,03
30,201503,SOUTH CAROLINA,WHILE APPROACHING BEAUFORT COUNTY AIRPORT (ABW) FROM THE NORTHWEST I COULD HEAR A CIRRUS AIRCRAFT ANNOUNCING HIS POSITION IN THE PATTERN.  I HEARD AND LATER OBSERVED THE CIRRUS OPERATING FROM THE AIRPORT FROM MY AIRCRAFT POSITION AS I APPROACHED FOR A LEFT BASE ENTRY. I ANNOUNCED MY POSITION ON CTAF AS BEAUFORT TRAFFIC ARROW LEFT BASE RUNWAY 7. THE CIRRUS PILOT BROADCASTS ON THE FREQUENCY THAT RUNWAY 7 IS RIGHT TRAFFIC. I ACKNOWLEDGED THE CIRRUS WITH A DOUBLE CLICK ON THE COMMUNICATION RADIO TRANSMIT BUTTON; AS I WAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED ON THE RIGHT BASE FOR RUNWAY 7. I OBSERVED THE CIRRUS ROLLING OUT ON RUNWAY 7 AND ENTER THE RUNUP AREA; LOCATED AT THE APPROACH END OF RUNWAY 25. I ANNOUNCED ON THE CTAF BEAUFORT TRAFFIC ARROW TURNING FINAL RUNWAY 7. I LANDED WHILE OBSERVING THE CIRRUS HOLDING IN THE RUNUP AREA AT RUNWAY 25. I ANNOUNCED BEAUFORT TRAFFIC ARROW BACK TAXI RUNWAY 25 TO THE RAMP. THE CIRRUS PILOT ANNOUNCED THAT HE HAD A DESIGNATED PILOT EXAMINER ON BOARD. TURNING OFF RUNWAY 25; I ANNOUNCED BEAUFORT TRAFFIC ARROW CLEAR ACTIVE; TAXI RAMP. I STOPPED MY AIRCRAFT AT A PARKING SPOT ON THE RAMP AND DEPARTED THE AIRCRAFT TO PUSH IT BACK TO THE TIE DOWN SPOT. AS I WAS STANDING AT THE NOSE OF MY AIRCRAFT AND PREPARING TO PUSH IT BACK; THE CIRRUS TAXIED BY ON THE RAMP WITH IT'S RIGHT WING ALMOST COLLIDING WITH ME AND MY PROPELLER SPINNER BY APPROXIMATELY 12 INCHES. I TOOK EVASIVE ACTION BY JUMPING TO THE SIDE OF THE MY AIRCRAFT AS THE CIRRUS PASSED BY. THE CIRRUS PROCEEDED TO TAXI ON THE RAMP TO THE TAXIWAY LEADING TO RUNWAY 7. THE CIRRUS TOOK OFF FROM RUNWAY 7 AND DEPARTED THE AIRPORT TRAFFIC AREA.AT NO TIME WAS THERE A RISK OF COLLISION WITH THE CIRRUS IN THE AIR OR ON THE RUNWAY OR TAXIWAY; EXCEPT WHEN THE CIRRUS ALMOST COLLIDED WITH ME AND MY AIRPLANE WHILE I WAS ATTEMPTING TO PUSH THE AIRCRAFT BACK INTO THE AIRCRAFT TIE DOWN AREA. THERE WAS NO CORRECTIVE ACTIONS TAKEN BY ME IN THE PATTERN; NOR ON THE RUNWAY; UNTIL AFTER MY AIRCRAFT WAS PARKED.,PA-28 Pilot reported that after landing at ABW another light aircraft taxied within a foot of his parked aircraft; possibly in response to the PA-28 flying an incorrect pattern.,2015,03
31,201503,VIRGINIA,WE JUST STARTED DESCENDING FROM FL190 PER ATC CLEARANCE WHEN AT ABOUT FL180 WE CAME WITHIN A VERY CLOSE DISTANCE TO WHAT LOOKED LIKE SEVERAL (3 OR MORE) SILVER/BLUE BALLOONS WITH A LARGE BOX (LOOKED BLACK) HANGING FROM IT. THEY WERE NOT THE STORE BOUGHT TYPE BALLOONS; RATHER; MUCH LARGER. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO TELL FROM THE COCKPIT AS TO WHETHER THE BALLOONS WERE CLIMBING OR DESCENDING; BUT I BELIEVE THEY WERE TRAVELING WITH THE WINDS ALOFT (APPROX 350/40). WE NOTIFIED ATC OF THE BALLOONS.FROM MY VIEW FROM FD; BALLOONS PASSED LESS THAN 50FT FROM LEFT WING AND LESS THAN 50 FT OF ALTITUDE. I WAS READY TO CORRECT COURSE; ALTITUDE BUT THE TIMING OF EVENT WAS RAPID. BY THE TIME I RECOGNIZED BALLOONS AND TURNED OFF AUTOPILOT BALLOONS WERE AT 9 O'CLOCK POSITION TO LEFT WING.[SUGGESTION] REQUIRE BALLOONS TRAVELING INTO CONTROLLED AIRSPACE TO BE EQUIPPED WITH TRANSPONDERS.,CRJ-200 Captain reported an NMAC with a cluster of balloons at FL180 on descent into PHL.,2015,03
32,201504,CALIFORNIA,THE CAPTAIN WAS NOT THAT FAMILIAR WITH FLYING INTO SFO FROM AIRPORT ZZZ. HE ALSO HAD MENTIONED THAT HE HAD NEVER FLOWN THIS MODEL OF THE 777 (I MENTION THIS BECAUSE HIS UNFAMILIARITY WITH THE FLAP SPEEDS BECAME A DISTRACTION). HE SEEMED TO BE NEW ON THE AIRCRAFT. DURING THE ARRIVAL BRIEFING; I MENTIONED THAT THEY USUALLY CLEAR US TO CROSS OSI AT 8000 FEET. HE ASKED ME IF THAT WOULD MAKE HIM LOW OR HIGH AT OSI AND I TOLD HIM THAT WOULD DEFINITELY MAKE HIM HIGH FOR THE APPROACH. HE BRIEFED THAT HE WOULD BE DOING A FLAPS 30 APPROACH. WE WERE CLEARED TO CROSS OSI AT 8000 AND THEN CLEARED TO A LOWER ALTITUDE ONCE WE PASSED OSI. ONCE WE PASSED OSI; THE CAPTAIN DESCENDED AT 250 KTS WITH THE SPEED BRAKES FULL OUT. THE AUTOPILOT WAS ENGAGED AT THIS TIME. ONCE CLEARED FOR THE APPROACH AND ON FINAL; HE BEGAN SLOWING DOWN. WHEN HE CALLED FOR FLAPS 5; WE WERE TOO FAST AND I TOLD HIM HE NEEDED TO SLOW DOWN MORE. AFTER THAT; I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT ORDER OF THINGS; AND AT SOME POINT HE DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPILOT; BUT I DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REALIZE HE HAD DONE SO. HE ASKED FOR 150 KTS AND THE GEAR DOWN AND ONCE THE GEAR WAS DOWN HE ASKED FOR FLAPS 25; THEREFORE GOING FROM FLAPS 5 RIGHT TO FLAPS 25. SINCE THE SPEED BRAKES WERE STILL OUT; WE GOT THE CAUTION MESSAGE AND HE QUICKLY STOWED THE HANDLE WHICH CAUSED THE AIRPLANE TO BALLOON. THEN I NOTICED WE WERE SLIGHTLY LOW ON THE GLIDE PATH.  IT WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY SO I DIDN'T THINK MUCH OF IT; HOWEVER; I WATCHED TO MAKE SURE HE MADE A CORRECTION TO STOP THE HIGH RATE OF DESCENT. I SAW HIM MAKE A SLIGHT CHANGE TO THE PITCH; ALTHOUGH IT WAS NOT ALL THE WAY UP TO THE FD PITCH BARS. I KNOW THAT THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR TENDS TO EXAGGERATE THE AMOUNT OF CORRECTION NEEDED AND YOU DON'T WANT TO CHASE THEM; SO THE FACT THAT HE SHOWED HE WAS AWARE HE WAS LOW AND CORRECTING PREVENTED ME FROM SAYING ANYTHING AT THAT TIME. I CONTINUED DOING THE LANDING CHECKLIST. AT SOME POINT HE CALLED FOR TARGET SPEED AND I WAITED FOR HIM TO CALL FOR FLAPS 30; WATCHING HIS SPEED CLOSELY AS HE WAS CALLING FOR FLAPS VERY CLOSE TO THE LIMIT SPEEDS.WITH THE CHECKLIST DONE; I MADE AN EARLY 1000 FT CALL (@ 1080 FT) AND SET THE MISSED APPROACH ALTITUDE. I THEN LOOKED OUTSIDE AND SAW 3 RED VASI LIGHTS WHICH IMMEDIATELY TURNED TO 4 RED VASI LIGHTS. I TOLD HIM HE NEEDED TO COME UP. AS SOON AS I SAID THAT; THE TOWER ISSUED AN ALTITUDE ALERT AND DIRECTED US TO CHECK OUR ALTITUDE AND MAKE AN IMMEDIATE CORRECTION. I THOUGHT ABOUT TELLING HIM TO GO-AROUND; BUT SINCE IT WAS CLEAR AND THIS TIME HE MADE A LARGER CORRECTION; I DID NOT.  AS HE WAS CORRECTING; I GLANCED AT OUR ALTITUDE AND IT SAID 970 FT; SO I'M GUESSING THE INCIDENT OCCURRED RIGHT AT 1000 FT. WE QUICKLY REACQUIRED THE GLIDESLOPE AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. HOWEVER; IN LIGHT OF A RECENT MISHAP; WHICH OCCURRED IN VMC; AND RECENT REPORTS OF DEVIATIONS AT OUR COMPANY; I REALIZE NOW THAT CALLING FOR A MISSED APPROACH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE RESPONSE AND THEREFORE THE SAFER COURSE OF ACTION.,B777 First Officer describes a Visual Approach to SFO by a Captain not entirely familiar with the airport or the aircraft; resulting in a slightly unstabilized approach and a low altitude alert from the Tower.,2015,04
33,201504,CALIFORNIA,ON THE RETURN LEG OF A CROSS COUNTRY HELICOPTER FLIGHT; I MADE THE DECISION TO LAND BRIEFLY FOR A TOUCH AND GO AT EL MONTE AIRPORT. COMING FROM THE EAST; I MADE A LEFT BASE ARRIVAL TO RUNWAY 19. WINDS WERE FROM THE SOUTHWEST; VISIBILITY WAS OVER 10 SM; THE SKY WAS CLEAR BELOW 12;000 AGL; AND VMC PREVAILED. I STARTED MY TAKEOFF ROLL DOWN RUNWAY 19; INTENDING TO MAKE A RIGHT CROSSWIND DEPARTURE NORTHWEST BOUND. I TURNED RIGHT CROSSWIND OVER THE LAST 1/4 OF THE RUNWAY AT APPROXIMATELY 125 FEET AGL. 1 OR 2 SECONDS AFTER I MADE THAT RIGHT TURN; APPROXIMATELY 100-300 FEET NORTH WEST OF RUNWAY 19; I SAW A BRIGHT BLUE FLASHING OBJECT DESCEND RAPIDLY FROM ABOVE MY AIRCRAFT AT MY 1:00 POSITION; TO BELOW MY AIRCRAFT AT MY 5:00 POSITION. THE OBJECT; WHICH APPEARED TO BE CIRCULAR IN SHAPE; WAS ABOUT 30 FEET AWAY FROM MY AIRCRAFT DURING ITS RAPID DESCENT. EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN IN THE FORM OF A RAPID STEEP LEFT BANK TO CLEAR MY ROTOR BLADES FROM THE UAV. AS SOON AS IT WAS CLEAR FROM MY VISION I MADE A STEEP RIGHT TURN TO ATTEMPT TO SEE WHERE THE OBJECT WAS DESCENDING TO; BUT I LOST SIGHT OF IT AND COULD NOT LOCATE IT AGAIN. THE FLYING OBJECT; ALTHOUGH I COULD NOT SEE IT VERY CLEARLY BECAUSE OF DARKNESS; APPEARED TO HAVE THE SHAPE OF A QUAD COPTER; OR MULTI ROTOR 'DRONE'. I WOULD ESTIMATE ITS WEIGHT LESS THAN 40 POUNDS; AND A DIAMETER OF 3-5 FEET. I BELIEVE THE INCIDENT TOOK PLACE DIRECTLY OVER AIRPORT PROPERTY; WHICH GREATLY CONCERNS ME. THE OPERATOR PROBABLY DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS AN AIRPORT THERE; OR AT LEAST I HOPE SO. I CANNOT CONCLUDE IF THE OBJECTS RAPID DESCENT WAS INTENTIONAL ON THE PART OF THE OPERATOR; OR IF IT WAS A RESULT OF THE DOWNWARD FLOW OF MY ROTOR WASH.,Helicopter pilot experiences an NMAC with a UAV during a night departure from EMT; about 200 feet AGL. Evasive action is taken.,2015,04
34,201504,CALIFORNIA,DEPARTING LVK DURING CLIMBOUT AT APPROX 4800 FEET WE FELT A BUMP IN THE AIRFRAME; AND HEARD A THUD. NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE NOTED; AND AFTER DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION OF THE AIRCRAFT INSTRUMENTS AND VISUAL AREAS OF THE AIRFRAME; WE CONTINUED ON TO DESTINATION. AFTER LANDING I EXAMINED THE AIRCRAFT AND FOUND A 3 INCH LONG DAMAGED AREA ON THE LOWER NOSE COWL; AND SCRATCH MARKS ON THE BACK OF 2 OF THE 3 PROPELLER BLADES NEAR THE PROPELLER ROOT AND AT A POSITION CONSISTENT WITH THE NOSE DAMAGE. NO OTHER DAMAGE WAS NOTED. THE AIRCRAFT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY INSPECTED BY AN INSPECTION AUTHORITY (IA) [MECHANIC] AND CONFIRMED TO BE AIRWORTHY.I BELIEVE WE STRUCK A SMALL UAV BEING OPERATED IN THE VICINITY OF THE DEL VALLE RESERVOIR; IN VIOLATION OF THE APPLICABLE FARS. IF THE DEVICE HAD BEEN 1 FOOT HIGHER; IT LIKELY WOULD HAVE IMPACTED THE WINDSHIELD WITH DEVASTATING RESULTS.,Single engine small aircraft pilot reports a collision with an object; possibly a small UAV; at 4;800 feet over the Del Valle reservoir after departing LVK. Scratches on the cowling and two of the three propeller blades were noted on post flight.,2015,04
35,201504,COLORADO,I WAS TRAINING ON THE RADAR POSITION ON SECTOR 30.  TRAFFIC WAS LIGHT AND NOT COMPLEX.  AIRCRAFT X CHECKED IN WESTBOUND AT FL340 AND THEN SHORTLY AFTER I ACKNOWLEDGED THE CHECK IN; HE REPORTED THAT HE HAD JUST SEEN A WEATHER BALLOON PASS DIRECTLY BENEATH HIS FLIGHT PATH ABOUT 1;000 FEET BELOW.  THE SECTOR TEAM HAD NOT BEEN MADE AWARE THAT A WEATHER BALLOON WITHOUT A TRANSPONDER WAS TO BE LAUNCHED ANYWHERE NEAR OUR AIRSPACE; BUT IT TURNED UP ON MY BOUNDARY WITH ANOTHER SECTOR AT APPROXIMATELY FL330.  WE NOTIFIED THE SUPERVISOR WHO WAS AWARE OF THE BALLOON BUT NOT THE EXACT WHEREABOUTS BECAUSE IT WAS NOT EQUIPPED WITH A TRANSPONDER.  HE DID COME BACK TO THE SECTOR TEAM WITH MUCH MORE INFORMATION ABOUT THE BALLOON BUT AFTER THE AIRCRAFT HAD ALREADY REPORTED PASSING OVER IT.  THE PILOT THEN ADVISED ME THAT HE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT WE PROVIDE VECTORS TO ANY OTHER AIRCRAFT FLYING THROUGH THE AREA.  THIS IS AN UNSAFE SITUATION BECAUSE WE HAVE WEATHER BALLOONS THAT WE CANNOT IDENTIFY WITH THE RADAR THAT ARE CLIMBING AND DESCENDING THROUGH AIR TRAFFIC WITHOUT US HAVING ANY KNOWLEDGE OF WHERE THEY ARE ACTUALLY AT IN REAL TIME OR WHAT ALTITUDE THEY ARE AT.  WE WERE TOLD THAT THE OPERATORS HAD A WAIVER IN WHICH A TRANSPONDER WAS NOT REQUIRED BECAUSE OF THE SIZE; BUT THE CONCERN OF THE PILOT LEADS ME TO BELIEVE THAT NO PILOT WOULD WANT TO HIT ONE OF THOSE BALLOONS CRUISING AT FL 340.  THERE IS PRESCRIBED PHRASEOLOGY IN THE 7110.65 ABOUT UNMANNED BALLOON OPERATIONS BUT THE VERBIAGE IS VAGUE; AND TIES OUR HANDS SINCE A PILOT CAN REQUEST A VECTOR AROUND THE AREA WHERE THE BALLOON LAST WAS; BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHERE IT IS IN REAL TIME SO WE COULD ACTUALLY BE VECTORING THE AIRCRAFT IN THE PATH OF THE BALLOON WITHOUT KNOWING IT.  MANY PEOPLE IN THE FACILITY BELIEVE THIS TO BE A PROBLEM AND WE'VE SEEN MANY BALLOONS GO UP AND COME DOWN WITHOUT ISSUE; BUT AFTER HEARING THE PILOT'S CONCERN AND MYSELF AND MY TRAINER HAVING NO PREVIOUS KNOWLEDGE OF IT; I BELIEVE THERE NEED TO BE CHANGES TO THE PROCEDURES REGARDING WEATHER BALLOONS.I BELIEVE THAT ALL WEATHER BALLOONS SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH A TRANSPONDER SO WE KNOW THE EXACT LOCATION AND ALTITUDE BECAUSE THEN WE COULD ACTUALLY PROVIDE A HELPFUL VECTOR TO AIRCRAFT THAT REQUEST IT.  WE CAN ALSO ADVISE AIRCRAFT MORE ACCURATELY.,ZDV Controllers reports that an aircraft under his control reported a balloon at FL350. The controller did not know anything about the balloon but the FLM was aware of the balloon.,2015,04
36,201504,FLORIDA,ON APPROACH IN TO PBI WE WERE VECTORED TO JOIN THE ILS 10L. CONTROLLER GAVE US 150 HEADING TO JOIN AND 2000 FEET CLEARED FOR THE ILS. AS WE CROSSED ZISUR TOWER ISSUED A DRONE SIGHTING ON FINAL (ANYWHERE FROM 1000 FEET-2000 FEET); AT WHICH I HAD JUST CAUGHT GLIMPS OF IT DIRECTLY ON THE CENTERLINE AND 100-200 FEET ABOVE OUR ALTITUDE. IT PASSED DIRECTLY ABOVE US AND DID NOT CAUSE US TO MANEUVER THE AIRCRAFT TO MISS IT. WE NOTIFIED TOWER OF ITS LOCATION AND ALTITUDE. LANDING WAS UNEVENTFUL.WE UNLOADED THE PASSENGERS AND DID NOT SAY ANYTHING ABOUT THE DRONE AS WE WERE UNLOADING SINCE IT DID NOT INVOLVE ANY MANEUVERING ON OUR BEHALF. PBI TOWER CALLED THE FBO AND ASKED US TO CALL. WHEN I CALLED HE WANTED TO KNOW THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DRONE AND THEY WERE CALLING THE SHERIFF TO GO FIND ITS OPERATOR. THE DRONE WAS SQUARE AND APPROX. 2'X2'. APPEARED TO BE SILVER AND LOOK LIKE A QUAD COPTER.THERE WAS VERY LITTLE WE COULD DO AS A CREW BESIDES MAINTAIN OUTSIDE TRAFFIC SCANNING. AFTER CATCHING SIGHT; WE ALERTED TOWER TO THE EXACT LOCATION (ZISUR) AND IT APPEARED TO BE RIGHT AT 2000 FEET.  HAD THE GLIDESLOPE NOT CAPTURED WE MOST LIKELY WOULD HAVE HAD TO MANEUVER THE AIRCRAFT OR WOULD HAVE HIT THE DRONE.,CL300 flight crew is informed by PBI Tower of a drone sighting by a previous aircraft; near ZISUR on the ILS 10L. The drone is sighted at ZISUR and the crew passes 100-200 feet beneath it without maneuvering.,2015,04
37,201504,KENTUCKY,WE WERE AT 7000 FEET MSL; APPROXIMATELY 4 NM FROM THE APPROACH END OF CVG RUNWAY 18L ON THE DOWNWIND LEG; AND HAD JUST RECEIVED A VECTOR FOR LEFT BASE AND DESCENT TO 4000 IN PREPARATION FOR A VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 18L. AS I BEGAN THE TURN AND DESCENT; A RED AND BLACK SQUARISH VEHICLE APPEARED ON OUR RIGHT; APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET AT OUR ONE TO TWO O'CLOCK (IN THE TURN;) ABOUT 50 FEET ABOVE US IN THE DESCENDING TURN. IT WAS SOUTHBOUND; SO I DID NOT GET A LONG LOOK; BUT I WOULD GUESS IT WAS A QUADCOPTER.,LJ60 Captain reports sighting a UAV at 5;000 feet while on downwind for Runway 18L at CVG.,2015,04
38,201504,NEW YORK,A C303 IN THE VFR TRAFFIC PATTERN; ON A RIGHT BASE TO RUNWAY 34 AT APPROXIMATELY 3;000 FEET; REPORTED SIGHTING A 'UAV' APPROXIMATELY 500-1;000 FEET BELOW HIM.  THIS WAS REPORTED TO THE CONTROL TOWER ON TOWER FREQUENCY.  THE TOWER CONTROLLER REPORTED THIS TO THE OCIC.  THE OCIC FAILED TO LOG THE INCIDENT OR FILE AN MOR.  NO RECORD OF CONTACTING ANYONE ELSE; INCLUDING LAW ENFORCEMENT. TRAINING ON 'DRONE' PROCEDURES/REPORTING REQUIREMENTS.,BGM Tower is informed of a UAV in the traffic pattern by a C303 pilot. Unfortunately the OCIC failed to log the incident or file an MOR.,2015,04
39,201504,VIRGINIA,ON THE DESCENT INTO ORF WE WERE IN SMOOTH VMC CONDITIONS. WE WERE CLEARED DIRECT TO CALEY FOR THE ILS 5. I WAS IN THE PROCESS OF BEGINNING TO SLOW THE AIRCRAFT WHEN WE NOTICED TRAFFIC IN FRONT OF US OVER CALEY AS WE OBSERVED AND DISCUSSED THIS TRAFFIC ATC CAME OVER THE RADIO AND ADVISED US OF IT. AT THAT TIME WE ENCOUNTERED SEVERE TURBULENCE WITH ROLL RATES IN EXCESS OF 35 DEGREES AND AIRSPEED CHANGES IN EXCESS OF 30 KNOTS THE AIRCRAFT FOR A SHORT TIME WAS UNCONTROLLABLE. DURING THIS ENCOUNTER WHILE TRYING TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT WE HAD A BIRD STRIKE TO COMPLICATE MATTERS. I IMMEDIATELY EXECUTED A CLIMB AND ADVISED THE FIRST OFFICER TO LET ATC KNOW WE WERE CLIMBING AND ASKED FOR HEADING. WE CLIMBED TO 4;000 FEET ON A HEADING AND ONCE CLEAR OF THE WORST OF THE TURBULENCE (BELOW 3;000 FEET) BEGAN TO ASSESS THE SITUATION. ANOTHER REGIONAL JET WAS ALSO IN THE AREA AND WAS BEHIND US ON THE APPROACH AT A LOWER ALTITUDE. WE WAITED TO SEE THE OUTCOME OF HIS APPROACH. HE ADVISED THE WORST WAS BETWEEN 3;000 AND 1;600 WITH MODERATE BELOW 1;000 FEET. I ELECTED TO ATTEMPT A 2ND APPROACH WITH THE INTENTION OF DIVERTING IF IT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL. ON THE SECOND APPROACH THE TURBULENCE WAS ONLY MODERATE WITH NOWHERE NEAR WHAT WE ENCOUNTERED THE FIRST TIME. WE CONTINUED THE APPROACH AND LANDING UNEVENTFULLY AND THE AIRCRAFT LOGBOOK WAS NOTED TO THE BIRD STRIKE AS WELL AS ENCOUNTER WITH SEVERE TURBULENCE. NO PASSENGERS OR CREW SUSTAINED INJURY DURING THIS ENCOUNTER.,CRJ900 Captain experiences severe turbulence during approach to ORF at 3000 feet; followed quickly by a bird strike.

40,201505,ARIZONA,WAS IN CRUISE ON A TRAINING FLIGHT; JUST WEST OF RIO VERDE COMMUNITY (VPRVC) WHEN I SAW A PERSONAL DRONE OR UAV OF A QUAD-COPTER STYLE PASS 50 FEET AWAY ON THE LEFT SIDE OF MY AIRCRAFT.  I REPORTED THE OCCURRENCE TO PHX APPROACH.  I WAS AT 6500 FEET WHEN I SAW THE DRONE.,DA40 Instructor pilot reports a NMAC with a drone at 6;500 feet beneath PHX Class B airspace.,2015,05
41,201505,ARIZONA,ON DEPARTURE WITH FFZ TOWER; WE WERE 2 NM SOUTH OF RC PARK (NEAR APACHE JUNCTION) AT 3;700 FEET MSL WHEN MY STUDENT NOTICED A RC (REMOTE CONTROL) HELICOPTER ABOUT 300 FEET BELOW THE AIRCRAFT WITH GREEN/RED LIGHTS; ABOUT 3 FEET WIDE WITH A BLACK BODY.,A pilot departing FFZ reported a near miss with a UAV at 3;700 feet.,2015,05
42,201505,ARIZONA,DRONE WAS SPOTTED APPROXIMATELY 1 NM NE OF FFZ. AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A BALLOON; BUT THEN REALIZED IT WAS HOVERING IN THE SAME SPOT AS LAST TIME; AND THEN I REALIZED IT WAS A DRONE. IT WAS HOVERING NEAR THE RIGHT BASE TURN FOR RUNWAY 22R. A (POLICE HELICOPTER) WAS NEARBY; AND CAME TO INVESTIGATE AFTER I REPORTED IT TO TOWER. THEY DID NOT FIND ANY DRONE; BUT DID INVESTIGATE A SUSPICIOUS VEHICLE NEAR THE AREA WHERE THE DRONE WAS OPERATING.,PA28 pilot reports sighting a drone in the FFZ traffic pattern and reporting it to the Tower.,2015,05
43,201505,COLORADO,AFTER A BIRD STRIKE INSPECTION WAS COMPLETED AND WE WERE READY TO DEPART; FO TRIED TO ARM R1 DOOR. TRIED MULTIPLE TIMES AND CAME UP TO COCKPIT AND INFORMED ME THAT HE COULDN'T ARM R1. I WENT BACK TO SEE IF I COULD HELP HIM OR ARM IT AND I COULDN'T DO EITHER - THE ARM HANDLE WOULDN'T GO ALL THE WAY TO THE ARMED POSITION. WE OPENED THE DOOR TO SEE IF THERE WAS SOMETHING IN THE DOOR TRACK THAT WAS RESTRICTING THE DOOR FROM BEING ARMED AND SAW SOME CORDS AND A CARABINER TYPE CONNECTOR HANGING DOWN OFF OF THE DOOR. WE GOT THE MECHANIC TO LOOK AT IT. AFTER HIS INSPECTION; HE SAID THAT THE ACTIVATION LINE WAS WRAPPED AROUND THE GIRT BAR AND HE WOULD HAVE TO MEL THE SLIDE. HE DID THAT AND WE CONTINUED TO DESTINATION.,B757 Captain is informed by the First Officer that he cannot arm the R1 door. Maintenance is called and indicates that the slide may have been improperly installed and will have to be deferred.,2015,05
44,201505,FLORIDA,I WAS ASKED TO WORK THE RADAR ASSIST (RA)-POSITION AT BREWTON TO ASSIST THE RADAR CONTROLLER SINCE THERE WAS A LOT OF CONVECTIVE WEATHER IN THE SECTOR AS WELL AS ACTIVE MILITARY AIRSPACE OVER THE PANHANDLE COASTLINE OF FLORIDA.  WHEN I PLUGGED IN; EGLIN RESTRICTED AREAS 2914; 2915 WERE ACTIVE ABOVE THE EGLIN APPROACH CONTROL UP TO FL250.  W-151 AND W-155 WARNING AREAS WERE ACTIVE TO FL500 AND FL320 RESPECTIVELY.  I IMMEDIATELY MADE A REQUEST TO THE AREA SUPERVISOR TO REQUEST THE BREEDING RELEASE AREA THROUGH THE JACKSONVILLE CENTER (ZJX) MISSION CONTROLLER IN TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT UNIT (TMU).  A FEW MINUTES LATER; THE AREA SUPERVISOR ADVISED MYSELF AND THE RADAR CONTROLLER AT BREWTON THAT THE W-151 BREEDING RELEASE AREA WAS RELEASED TO BREWTON SECTOR AT OR ABOVE FL260; BUT W-155 BREEDING RELEASE AREA WAS STILL ON REQUEST. HOWEVER; THE PORTION OF W-151 BELOW THE BREEDING RELEASE AREA WAS UPDATED ON THE RADAR DISPLAY AT BREWTON TO DISPLAY ALTITUDES ACTIVE 000 TO FL260; INDICATING THAT THE W-151 AIRSPACE WAS ACTIVE UP TO FL260 AND THE BREEDING RELEASE AREA WAS RELEASED TO US FL270 AND ABOVE.  ON THE OTHER HAND; THE AREA STATUS INFORMATION BOARD DISPLAYED WHAT THE AREA SUPERVISOR HAD TOLD US; THE BREEDING RELEASE AREA ABOVE W-151 WAS RELEASED TO US AT OR ABOVE FL260.  I ASKED THE SUPERVISOR TO CLARIFY WITH THE ZJX MISSIONS CONTROLLER TO VERIFY THE ALTITUDE INPUTS ON THEIR EN ROUTE ATOMIZATION MODERNIZATION (ERAM) AIR TRAFFIC SPECIALIST WORKSTATION (ATSW) SO OUR RADAR DISPLAY WOULD SHOW OUR SPECIAL USE AIRSPACE (SUA) ALTITUDES CORRECTLY.  THE AREA SUPERVISOR THEN RETURNED TO THE BREWTON SECTOR TO INFORM US NOW THE BREEDING RELEASE AREA ABOVE W-155 HAD BEEN RELEASED TO BREWTON SECTOR AT OR ABOVE FL260.  AGAIN; THE SIA DISPLAYS WERE UPDATED ON THE RADAR SCOPE FROM THE MISSION CONTROLLER'S ENTRIES IN THE ATSW; BUT AGAIN THE ALTITUDE LIMITS WERE DISPLAYED INCORRECTLY AS THE W-155 UNDER THE BREEDING RELEASE AREA WAS ACTIVE 000 TO FL260 AND THE BREEDING RELEASE AREA WAS ACTIVE FL270 AND ABOVE.  ONCE MORE I ASKED THE AREA SUPERVISOR TO CLARIFY WITH THE MISSION CONTROLLER AS TO WHAT WERE THE CORRECT ALTITUDES.  MEANWHILE; THE EGLIN APPROACH MISSION CONTROLLER CALLED ME ON THE VOICE LINE TO ASK IF WE WERE DISPLAYING THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE COASTLINE 'CLOSED.'  I INFORMED THE EGLIN APPROACH CONTROLLER WE WERE NOT; BUT WE WERE SHOWING R2914 AND R2915 ACTIVE UP TO FL250.  THE EGLIN APPROACH CONTROLLER TOLD ME THAT THE R2914 SHOULD HAVE CHANGED TO BE ACTIVE UP TO FL400 AND R2915 SHOULD HAVE CHANGED TO BE ACTIVE UP TO FL350.  I ASKED THE EGLIN CONTROLLER IF A CARRIER JET ROUTED TOWARDS THE RESTRICTED AIRSPACE AND ABOUT 4 MINUTES FLYING TIME FROM ENTERING THE AIRSPACE COULD TRANSITION THROUGH IT WITH EGLIN APPROACH'S APPROVAL.  THE APPROACH CONTROLLER COULD NOT GIVE ME AN AFFIRMATIVE ANSWER AND TOLD ME TO STAND BY.  I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE RADAR CONTROLLER AND AREA SUPERVISOR THAT THE RESTRICTED AIRSPACE ABOVE EGLIN APPROACH WAS ACTIVE HIGHER THAN WE HAD BEEN BRIEFED AND DISPLAYED ON OUR RADAR DISPLAY AND ON THE AREA INFORMATION BOARD.  I ALSO INFORMED THE AREA SUPERVISOR THAT WE HAD AN AIRCRAFT ABOUT TO ENTER THE AIRSPACE WITH NO PRIOR APPROVAL OR COORDINATION.  THE BREWTON RADAR CONTROLLER INITIATED A VECTOR TO THE CARRIER FLIGHT TO THE SOUTH OF THE RESTRICTED AIRSPACE TO KEEP THE FLIGHT WITHIN THE BREEDING RELEASE AREA AIRSPACE.  ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE RESTRICTED AIRSPACE; THE RADAR CONTROLLER HAD ALREADY CLEARED AN AIRCRAFT LANDING PENSACOLA (PNS) TO FL260 ALONG THE BOUNDARY OF THE BREEDING AREA AND OVERTOP THE R2915 AIRSPACE.  THE RADAR CONTROLLER WAS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS WITHIN THE BREEDING RELEASE AREA AND ABOVE THE RESTRICTED AIRSPACE; BUT AFTER THE CONFUSION WE WERE UNSURE IF WE HAD LOST SEPARATION WITH THE SUA AIRSPACE AT THIS POINT.   I AGAIN ASKED THE SUPERVISOR TO GET CLARIFICATION OF THE STATUS OFF ALL THE ACTIVE MILITARY AIRSPACE WITHIN THE BREWTON SECTOR.  HE RETURNED TO INFORM US THAT THE RESTRICTED AIRSPACE WOULD BE STAYING ACTIVE AT OR BELOW FL250 AND THAT THE BREEDING RELEASE AREAS WERE RELEASED TO BREWTON AT OR ABOVE FL260 AND THAT HE REQUESTED THE MISSION CONTROLLER TO UPDATE THE SYSTEMS INFORMATION AREA (SIA) ALTITUDE LIMIT ENTRIES IN THE ATWS.  THE ALTITUDE LIMITS DISPLAYED ON THE RADAR FOR BREWTON SECTOR NOW DISPLAYED W151 AND W155 UNDERNEATH THE BREEDING RELEASE AREAS ACTIVE 000 TO FL259.  THIS STILL DID NOT INDICATE THAT THE BREEDING RELEASE AREA WAS RELEASED TO BREWTON AT OR ABOVE FL260 SINCE WE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE 1;000 FOOT SEPARATION ABOVE SUAS.  I CALLED THE MISSION POSITION IN TMU TO INQUIRE THE INFORMATION AND THE CONTROLLER TOLD ME [THEY WERE] WAS TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT THE ISSUE AND THAT SHE WOULD JUST CHANGE THE ALTITUDE LIMITS TO 000 TO FL250 TO MAKE US HAPPY SINCE SHE DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO ARGUE OVER THE ISSUE BEFORE A TELCON WAS STARTING.  THE ENTIRE SCENARIO WAS ONE OF MASS CONFUSION; UNNECESSARY MOVEMENT OF AIRCRAFT AND POTENTIAL LOSS OF SEPARATION.  MYSELF AND THE RADAR CONTROLLER WERE DISTRACTED FROM THE OPERATIONAL ENVIRONMENT DUE TO LACK OF ADEQUATE COORDINATION; AND INABILITY FOR THE MISSIONS CONTROLLER TO ACCURATELY DISPLAY SUA ALTITUDE LIMITS IN THE ATWS.  THE AREA SUPERVISOR INDICATED THAT THERE WAS A 'GIFT GIVING CEREMONY OR PARTY' OCCURRING IN THE TMU AREA AND IT SEEMED AS THOUGH THEY WERE DISTRACTED FROM THEIR JOBS.  THERE CERTAINLY SEEMED TO BE A COMPLETE LACK OF UNDERSTANDING AS TO WHAT AIRSPACE WAS ACTIVE AND TO WHAT ALTITUDES.  BREWTON SECTOR WAS COMPLEX ENOUGH AT THE TIME WITH WEATHER; THIS ADDITIONAL DISTRACTION WAS NOT NEEDED.REMOVE EXTERNAL DISTRACTIONS FROM AREAS.  ENSURE THE SUA DATA THAT IS COMMUNICATED TO THE AREAS IS ACCURATELY ENTERED INTO ATWS ENTRIES.  ENSURE TMU MISSION CONTROLLERS UNDERSTAND THE REQUIRED LOAS; SOPS; AND OTHER PUBLICATIONS SPECIFYING REQUIRED SEPARATION STANDARDS FOR MILITARY OPERATIONS AND AIR TRAFFIC.,A Jacksonville Center (ZJX) radar associate Controller reports of confusion around restricted areas being hot or not and how high the altitudes were if they are hot or not. The Controller tried many times to get the correct answer from the Front Line Manager (FLM) and Traffic Management Coordinators (TMC). The Controller reports of; 'The entire scenario was one of mass confusion; unnecessary movement of aircraft and potential loss of separation.',2015,05
45,201505,MINNESOTA,WHEN I TOOK OVER SECTOR 24; FINLEY RADAR (QFI) HAD JUST BEEN TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE FOR MAINTENANCE. USUALLY WHEN THIS HAPPENS; AFFECTED ADJACENT FACILITIES ARE NOTIFIED. AIRCRAFT X HAD ALREADY DEPARTED RDR BUT WAS STILL IN GFK APPROACH AIRSPACE. A SHORT TIME LATER THEY CALLED A HANDOFF. I ADVISED THEM THAT OUR RADAR WAS OUT AND TO TERMINATE AND SHIP AIRCRAFT X TO ME. THE AIRCRAFT CHECKED ON REQUESTING CLEARANCE INTO R5402 AND R5403 WHICH I COULD NOT DO AS THOSE AIRSPACE WERE NOT ACTIVE UNTIL ABOUT 20 MINUTES.AS THIS WAS ALL PLAYING OUT; THE QUESTION WAS RAISED THAT THESE DRONES CANNOT BE OPERATING IN OUR AIRSPACE IF OUR RADAR IS OUT OF SERVICE AS WE CANNOT RADAR MONITOR THEM. IN THE MEANTIME; A SECOND AIRCRAFT; AIRCRAFT Y; DEPARTED HEADING FOR THE AIRSPACE. BY THIS TIME IT WAS DECIDED TO RECALL THE RADAR.IN THIS SITUATION; HAVING A PREDETERMINED NON-RADAR ROUTE TO TRANSITION FROM APPROACH CONTROL INTO THE RESTRICTED AREAS WOULD HAVE SOLVED THE PROBLEM. IN THE BIGGER PICTURE; THERE IS A BIG PUSH FROM THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT TO GET THESE DRONES INTEGRATED INTO THE AIRSPACE SYSTEM. YET; VERY LITTLE THOUGHT SEEMS TO [BE] GIVEN BY THESE INDIVIDUALS AS TO WHAT IT REALLY INVOLVES; HOW COMPLEX IT IS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY; HOW TO DO IT SAFELY. ALL THAT SEEMS TO MATTER IS IT NEEDS TO BE DONE SO THAT PEOPLE CAN MAKE MONEY.THIS IS A VERY DANGEROUS PATH TO FOLLOW AND CAN ONLY LEAD TO SERIOUS PROBLEMS DOWN THE ROAD. SAFETY SHOULD BE THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS; NOT MONEY. PROCEDURES NEED TO BE DEVELOPED TO INSURE SAFE OPERATION FOR ALL INVOLVED. THESE PROCEDURES NEED TO BE CLEAR AND NOT BURIED IN LEGAL TERMS.,ZMP Controllers describe the radar being released to Maintenance for a specific time; then realized that they shouldn't be operating drones in the airspace if they don't have radar. Controllers then advise they get the radar back in service. Controllers state it is a big push to get drones integrated into the NAS; yet very little thought is being given to provide the controllers specific procedures.,2015,05
46,201505,NEW YORK,UPON CHECKING ON WITH LGA TOWER; WE WERE ISSUED AN UNAUTHORIZED UNMANNED DRONE ACTIVITY AT 1000 FEET.  WHEN WE APPROACHED 1000 FEET; WE WERE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR THIS DRONE.  WHILE SCANNING THE SKY; SOMETHING CAUGHT MY EYES AT THE 2 O'CLOCK POSITION LOW.  I SHIFTED MY FOCUS TOWARDS THE OBJECT; AND SURE ENOUGH; THERE WAS A WHITE QUADCOPTER MANEUVERING BELOW AND TO THE RIGHT OF OUR FIGHT PATH.  THE SIGHTING WAS ONLY A FRACTION OF A SECOND; BUT I WAS ABLE TO MAKE A MENTAL NOTE OF THE POSITION DUE TO THE UNIQUE SHAPE OF THE CONDOS/APARTMENT BUILDINGS BELOW.  OUR APPROACH AND LANDING WAS NORMAL AND UNEVENTFUL.  THERE WAS NO COLLISION DANGER AND NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN.  ONCE WE SHUT DOWN AT THE GATE; I CHECKED THE POSITION OF THE CONDO BUILDINGS AND OBTAIN A ROAD INTERSECTION VIA GOOGLE MAPS SATELLITE VIEW.,B737 First Officer reports sighting a drone; first reported by LGA Tower; 3 NM NNE at 1;000 feet during approach to Runway 22. No evasive action was required.,2015,05
47,201505,NORTH CAROLINA,WHILE ON A LEFT DOWNWIND FOR 36L IN CLT AT AN ALTITUDE OF 5000 FEET THE FIRST OFFICER (FO) (AND PILOT FLYING) FIRST SPOTTED A SMALL DRONE. IT PASSED FROM 2 O'CLOCK TO 8 O'CLOCK IN DIRECTION RELATIVE TO OUR FLIGHT AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE BETWEEN 5-10 [FEET] ABOVE OUR AIRCRAFT. THE WHOLE EVENT LASTED ABOUT 1-2 SECONDS.  IT WAS VERY BRIEF DUE TO OUR SPEED OF 190 KTS AND ITS SLOW SPEED.  I AGAIN GOT EYES ON IT FOR ABOUT 1 SECOND.  I ESTIMATE ITS WING SPAN TO BE 2-3 FEET AND OF THE HOBBY OR HOME BUILT TYPE.  THE FO STATED HE THINKS THE COLOR WAS SILVER OR BLUE.  I VIEWED IT TOO QUICK TO NOTICE.  THE DRONE PASSED SO FAST THAT NO ACTION COULD BE TAKEN.  WE NOTIFIED ATC AND THEY DID A GOOD JOB OF MAKING CALL OUTS TO OTHER TRAFFIC IN THE AREA. SEE AND AVOID.  DON'T HIT THEM.  DON'T ALLOW THEM IN BUSY CLASS B AIRSPACE.,CRJ200 Captain reports sighting a UAV (model aircraft) at 5;000 feet while on left downwind for Runway 36L at CLT.,2015,05

49,201505,TEXAS,BEFORE WE DEPARTED; WE KNEW WE WOULD NEED A NEW ROUTE; WHICH WE RECEIVED THEN; WE CALLED THE FUEL TRUCK OVER TO GIVE US MORE FUEL FOR THE NEW ROUTE. UP TO 8000LBS I BELIEVE.  THE NEW ROUTE HAD US GOING ZZZ (VOR).DIESL.MSCT4 INTO IAH. ONCE AIRBORNE; WE NEEDED TO DEVIATE AROUND A LOW OVERHANG FROM THE LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS TO OUR EAST; WHICH IS WHY WE NEEDED A REROUTE. MADE CONTACT WITH CENTER; AND THEY IMMEDIATELY TURNED US NORTH TOWARDS IRW.TORNN. DRLLR4 INTO IAH. WE TOLD THEM THAT MIGHT NOT BE POSSIBLE. WE TRIED TO NEGOTIATE OUR WAY BACK DOWN SOUTH; BUT TO NO AVAIL. THE CAPTAIN AND I DETERMINED WE HAD ENOUGH FUEL TO REACH IRW PLUS EXTRA TO GET US TO AN AIRPORT WELL EAST OF THE LINE OF WEATHER TO REFUEL; AND CONTINUE ON TO IAH. WE LEVELED OFF AT FL370 FOR ABOUT 20-30 MINS OR SO. ENTERED IMC CONDITIONS AND NOTICED CONDENSATION ON THE INSIDE OF THE WINDSHIELD. FROST FORMED ON THE UNHEATED PORTIONS OF THE WINDSHIELD. ABOUT A MINUTE LATER; WE NOTICED THAT MY AIRSPEED BEGAN TO DROP RAPIDLY; ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ZERO IN A MATTER OF SECONDS. NO CHANGES TO THE AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN MADE. THE TL'S WERE STILL SET FOR LRC; AND OUR ALTITUDE NEVER CHANGED. THE CAPTAIN GOT AN AMBER IAS MISCOMPARE MESSAGE ON HIS PFD; AND HIS AIRSPEED INDICATOR MATCHED THE STANDBY AIRSPEED INDICATIONS. WE RECOGNIZED THAT PITOT 2 HAS BEEN BLOCKED; MOST LIKELY BY ICE. WE RAN THE NAV/FLIGHT INSTRUMENT FAILURE (QRH) QUICK REFERENCE HANDBOOK PROCEDURE AND IT GUIDED US TO SELECT THE ADC REVERSION BUTTON ON MY REVERSIONARY PANEL. BY THE TIME I PUSHED THE BUTTON THE CAPTAIN NOTICED AN AMBER ALT MISCOMPARE ON HIS PFD AS WELL; AND WE NOTICED MY ALTIMETER WAS ABOUT 200 FT HIGH. THE SAME QRH PROCEDURE APPLIES TO THIS NEW MESSAGE. I PRESSED THE ADC REVERSION AND I AM NOW RECEIVING CROSS SIDE DATA FOR THE CAPTAIN'S ADC. THE QRH ALSO TELLS US WE ARE UNABLE RVSM. WE NOTIFIED ATC; AND WE REQUESTED TO STAY AT FL370 FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE FOR FUEL. IT TOOK THEM ABOUT 10 MINS TO GET BACK TO US ON THAT ANSWER; BUT IN THE MEANTIME; WE STAYED AT FL370 AND WE REALIZED IF WE CAN STAY AT FL370 WE CAN MAKE IT ALL THE WAY INTO IAH WITHOUT A FUEL STOP. WE HAD A GOOD TAILWIND THAT ZIPPED US UP TO IRW. ATC LET US STAY AT FL370 UNTIL WE MADE THE TURN TOWARD THE SOUTH.  ONCE WE MADE THE TURN SOUTHBOUND; ATC WAS GIVING US A SERIES OF RADAR VECTORS FOR SEQUENCING INTO IAH; WE DECLARED MIN FUEL; AND THEY INSTRUCTED US TO DESCEND TO FL280. WE WERE STILL UP BY IRW; SO WE KNEW DESCENDING TO FL280 WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OUR FUEL BURN; SO WE DECIDE TO DIVERT TO ZZZ1. AFTER LOTS OF COORDINATION BETWEEN US AND THE DISPATCHER HAD CALLED AHEAD TO ZZZ1 AND TOLD THEM OF OUR DIVERSION; WE AMENDED THE RELEASE AND OFF WE WENT. ON OUR WAY TO ZZZ1 IN IMC WE ENCOUNTERED SOME TURBULENCE; AND IT KICKED THE AUTOPILOT OFF. ONCE WE EXITED THE TURBULENCE THE AUTOPILOT WORKED WITHOUT ISSUE. ON THE DESCENT PASSING THROUGH 280-250 I DECIDED TO CHECK AND SEE IF MY PITOT TUBE WAS STILL BLOCKED. AT THIS POINT WE WERE IN VMC CONDITIONS AND STILL BELOW FREEZING; BUT MY AIRSPEED AND ALTITUDE WERE BACK TO NORMAL; AND WERE MATCHING UP WITH THE STAND BY AND PITOT 1 PERFECTLY. SO I AT THIS POINT NEVER RE-SELECTED THE ADC REVERSION BUTTON AGAIN.  ONCE WE LANDED IN ZZZ1; WE GOT MORE FUEL AND NO PASSENGERS DEPLANED DURING THE PROCESS. WE WERE ON THE GROUND FOR LESS THAN 20 MINS; BEFORE WE DEPARTED TO IAH WITHOUT ANY ISSUES.ONCE WE LANDED IN HOUSTON; WE DID NOT WRITE UP THE PITOT/STATIC 2 BLOCKAGE; BECAUSE THE ISSUE RESOLVED ITSELF BEFORE LANDING. I DO WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE ADC FAILURE WAS NOT THE PRIMARY REASON FOR DIVERTING. EVEN IF WE HAD STAYED UP AT FL370; THE DELAYED VECTORS AND SEQUENCING BY ATC USED UP TOO MUCH FUEL AND WE WOULD HAVE DIVERTED ANYWAY WITHOUT THE ADC FAILING. ALSO WE DID NOT WRITE IT UP BECAUSE IT WASN'T A CONVENTIONAL FAILURE OF THE ADC BECAUSE WE DID NOT GET ANY RED 'X'S' OVER THE AIRSPEED AND ALTITUDE TAPES. LOOKING BACK ON IT NOW; WE SHOULD HAVE WRITTEN UP THE PITOT/STATIC 2 BLOCKAGE SO MAINTENANCE CAN TRACK THE ISSUE SO THEY CAN DETERMINE IF THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM ON THE EMB-145 FLEET; AND OR THIS PARTICULAR AIRCRAFT. OVERALL I THINK US AS A CREW HANDLED THE SITUATION VERY WELL. THE CAPTAIN AND I HAD A SHARED MENTAL MODEL THE WHOLE FLIGHT. OUR COMMUNICATION WAS SPOT ON; AND WE EFFECTIVELY MANAGED THE THREATS AS TO NOT CAUSE AN UAS.  THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT DID AN OUTSTANDING JOB KEEPING THE PASSENGERS CALM; AND THE COORDINATION WITH OUR DISPATCHER WAS TEXT BOOK! THE REASON FOR MY EXTENDED DUTY TIME WAS THAT I HAD ABOUT 6 HOURS OF REST THEN HAD TO TEACH A CLASS AT THE TRAINING CENTER. WHICH COUNTS AS FDP IF I WAS GOING TO FLY LATER; WHICH I DIDN'T; BECAUSE I WOULD HAVE HAD AT LEAST 10 HOURS AFTER MY TRAINING EVENT. THERE WERE MANY THREATS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FLIGHT. THERE WAS THE LINE OF SEVERE WEATHER ALONG OUR ROUTE OF FLIGHT; IT WAS THE LAST LEG OF A FOUR DAY TRIP FOR THE CA AND FA; AND JUST THE LAST LEG OF A DAY TRIP FOR ME. THE SUN WAS SETTING.  ON THE GROUND ATC REROUTE AND AN AIRBORNE ATC REROUTE. IMC CONDITIONS AT HIGH ALTITUDES. LANDING IN ZZZ1; THE TOWER WAS CLOSED; AND IT HAD A SHORTER RUNWAY. WE WERE ABLE TO USE EFFECTIVE THREAT AND ERROR MANAGEMENT TO MANAGE THE THREATS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FLIGHT; UNDER ABNORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES SO WE NEVER GOT INTO AN UAS. I WOULD DEFINITELY HAVE MADE SURE THAT WE WROTE UP THE PITOT/STATIC BLOCKAGE; SO THAT IT CAN BE TRACKED IN OUR MAINTENANCE PROGRAM.  ON THE GROUND [AT OUR DEPARTURE AIRPORT] I COULD HAVE BEEN MORE PROACTIVE AND ASKED ATC IF THERE WERE ANY PROBLEMS WITH OUR FILED ROUTE; SO THAT WE COULD HAVE PUT MORE FUEL ON BOARD; AND AVOIDED A DIVERSION. I HOPE THE COMPANY CAN USE THE DATA ON THE PITOT/STATIC 2 BLOCKAGE TO SEE IF IT IS A RECURRING PROBLEM ON OUR AIRCRAFT TYPE; OR THIS PARTICULAR AIRPLANE.,EMB-145 crew diverted to alternate airport due to low fuel state caused by multiple vectors; icing and lower assigned altitude.,2015,05
50,201505,VIRGINIA,LEADING A 4-SHIP [FORMATION FLIGHT] THROUGH THE WASHINGTON; DC SFRA. BETWEEN WAKE TURBULENCE AND CONCERN FOR BIRDS THE FLIGHT'S ALTITUDE DROPPED BELOW THAT PRESCRIBED IN THE BRIEFING. SPEED ISSUES ALSO WERE CHALLENGING DUE TO THE VECTORING AND INSTRUCTIONS FROM POTOMAC TRACON. THESE TYPE OF AIRCRAFT; [ARE] A SLEEK AND SLICK PLATFORM THAT DOES NOT HAVE SPEED BRAKES. FURTHER; RAPID AND RANDOM POWER CHANGES ARE NOT RECOMMENDED FOR ENGINE SAFETY AND TO MAINTAIN THE INTEGRITY OF THE FORMATION. POWER REDUCTIONS NEED TO BE DONE GRADUALLY FOR ENGINE CARE AND OPERATION AND THEY NEED TO BE DONE EVEN MORE CAREFULLY WHEN MANAGING A FORMATION FLIGHT WHERE THREE OTHER AIRCRAFT ARE ALL READING OFF OF THE LEAD AIRPLANE.  IN SHORT; CONSIDERATION OF THE SAFETY OF THE FORMATION PRIORITY NUMBER ONE; MAKING RAPID CHANGES WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT AND UNSAFE. THE SPACING AND RECOMMENDED SPEED CHANGES MADE BY TRACON REQUIRED OUR 4-SHIP [FORMATION] TO ENCOUNTER WAKE TURBULENCE BEHIND [OTHER AIRCRAFT] PRIOR TO OUR ENTERING OF THE AIRSPACE.  THE ALTITUDE FACTORS WERE NOT ONLY WAKE-TURBULENCE; SPECIFICALLY HAWKS AND OTHER BIRD LIFE OPERATING AT AND ABOVE THE BRIEFING ALTITUDE AND THE LEAD PILOT MADE A COMMAND DECISION TO BE AT THE SAFE OR LOWER THAN BRIEFED ALTITUDE. OUR 4-SHIP ENCOUNTERED NUMEROUS POTENTIAL BIRD STRIKES AT THE BRIEFING ALTITUDE ON THE INBOUND PORTION OF THE FLIGHT.  SAFE OPERATION OF THE FLIGHT REQUIRED THE LEAD PILOT TO DESCEND BELOW BRIEFED MINIMUM TO AVOID WAKE TURBULENCE AND WILDLIFE. THE PROBLEM WAS FURTHER ENHANCED BY KNOWN PHOTO SHIP AIRCRAFT; CREATING ADDITIONAL SAFETY CONCERNS IN KEEPING WITH SAFE DISTANCE. JUDGMENT WAS USED IN KEEPING AMPLE SPEED AND SAFE ALTITUDE TO MAINTAIN FLIGHT PATH. AT NO TIME WAS THE FLIGHT PATH DEVIATED; BUT ALTITUDE AND SPEED WERE USED TO MAINTAIN SAFE FLIGHT OPERATIONS; FORMATION INTEGRITY AND SAFE FLIGHT.,Lead pilot of a warbird formation flight in Washington DC reported he deviated from assigned altitude because of concerns for wake turbulence and bird encounters.,2015,05
51,201506,ARIZONA,WE WERE CLIMBING OUT ON THE DEPARTURE APPROXIMATELY 4 MILES SOUTH OF FFZ CLIMBING THROUGH 3;300.  THE STUDENT IN THE BACK RIGHT SEAT REPORTED SEEING A BRIGHT RED CIRCULAR DRONE ABOUT 3 FEET IN DIAMETER PASS APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET BELOW US ON THE RIGHT SIDE.  I DID NOT SEE IT PERSONALLY BUT WE REPORTED IT TO FFZ TOWER WITH LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION.  IT WAS A BRIGHT RED IN COLOR.,A PA-44 crew reported a NMAC with a drone beneath PHX Class B airspace after departing FFZ.,2015,06
52,201506,ARIZONA,FLYING THE DEPARTURE; AT 3;700 FEET OVER THE RC SUPERSTITION AIR PARK; I SPOTTED A DRONE TRAVELING NORTHBOUND. I WAS TRAVELING SOUTH EAST BOUND. IT LOOKED LIKE A BASKETBALL; WITH VERTICAL ROTORS. WAS AT APPROXIMATELY AT 3;800 FEET. BLACK IN COLOR. REPORTED TO FFZ TOWER.,PA-28 pilot reports a NMAC with a UAV at 3;800 feet approximately 8 NM east of FFZ.,2015,06
53,201506,ARIZONA,FLYING THE PA44 NORTH OF CHD; ABOUT 4 MILES SOUTH OF FFZ; THE DRONE APPEARED TO THE LEFT OF THE LEFT WING TIP; AT CLOSE PROXIMITY. DRONE WAS RED WITH BLACK AND APPROXIMATELY HALF A FOOT IN DIAMETER. TOWER WAS IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED.,PA-44 instructor pilot reports an airborne conflict with a drone at 2;700 feet 4 NM south of FFZ. Evasive action is taken.,2015,06
54,201506,CALIFORNIA,I WAS FLYING LEVEL AT 9500 FEET MSL. I AM EQUIPPED WITH ADS-B IN AND OUT AND WAS OBSERVING TRAFFIC INCLUDING A CIRRUS THAT WAS POINTED OUT TO ME BY LOS ANGELES CENTER. WHILE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE CIRRUS I CAUGHT OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE MOVEMENT BELOW AND AHEAD OF ME. I THOUGHT IT TO BE ANOTHER AIRCRAFT LOW THEN MAYBE A WEATHER BALLOON BUT AS IT CAME TOWARD ME I REALIZED IT WAS A DRONE. IT WAS A SKELETAL BUILT RECTANGULAR CRAFT MAYBE 6 TO 8 FEET IN LENGTH WITH NO APPARENT AERODYNAMIC DESIGN. IT APPEARED TO HAVE MOTORS AFFIXED SIMILAR TO HOBBYIST DRONES ON ALL FOUR CORNERS BUT I COULD NOT BE SURE. IT PASSED UNDER MY WING AND I TURNED MY HEAD TO SEE IT PASS BEHIND MY AIRCRAFT AND MOVE OUT OF SIGHT. THIS HAPPENED IN ABOUT 10 SECONDS AND I WAS SURPRISED TO SEE A DRONE FLYING IN BUSY AIRSPACE BETWEEN THE GORMAN GMN AND VAN NUYS VNY VORS AT 9000 FEET. THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC DEPICTED FOR THIS DRONE BUT ALL OTHER TRAFFIC IN THE VICINITY WAS CLEARLY SHOWN ON MY MFD (MULTIFUNCTION FLIGHT DISPLAY).  THIS WAS A POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS AND DEADLY SITUATION AND I THOUGHT IT SHOULD BE REPORTED.,Baron 55 pilot at 9;500 feet between VNY and GMN VORs reports sighting a quadcopter type drone 500 feet below.,2015,06
55,201506,ILLINOIS,WHILE WORKING OUR WAY AROUND THUNDERSTORMS THAT WERE NEAR CHICAGO; WE HAD PITOT 2 FREEZE OVER IN FLIGHT. WE HAD NO EICAS MESSAGE INDICATING THAT WE HAD A FAILURE OF THE PITOT HEAT. WE HAD A CASS MESSAGE INDICATING THAT THERE WAS A SPLIT IN THE AIRSPEED. AS WE INCREASED AND DECREASED SPEED; THE FIRST OFFICER'S INDICATED SPEED REMAINED STEADY AS THE CAPTAIN AND STANDBY INDICATED SPEED MATCHED. AS WE DESCENDED THE FIRST OFFICER SHOWED A DECREASE IN SPEED AS WE DESCENDED. WE HAD A SLIGHT VARIATION IN ALTITUDE READING BETWEEN THE CAPTAIN AND FIRST OFFICER ALTIMETER. AS WE DESCENDED BELOW FL270 THE ICE APPARENTLY MELTED AS THE SPEED DECREASED TO ZERO; FOLLOWED BY AN INCREASE TO MATCH THE CAPTAIN AND STANDBY INDICATED SPEEDS.THE AIRCRAFT WAS NEVER IN A UAS AS WE CONTROLLED THE PLANE BY REFERENCE TO THE CAPTAIN AND STANDBY INSTRUMENTS.,EMB-145LR flight crew reported pitot tube 2 iced up and showed incorrect information. Indications returned to normal when the flight descended into warmer temperatures.,2015,06
56,201506,NORTH CAROLINA,I WAS THE INSTRUCTOR ON AN INSTRUMENT TRAINING FLIGHT; ENTERING A HOLD AT SDZ VOR SPECIFICALLY OUTBOUND ON PARALLEL ENTRY TO THE HOLD. CEILING AND VISIBILITY UNLIMITED. I SAW AN OBJECT WHICH APPEARED TO BE LIGHTED AT A MILE OR LESS ABOUT 50 FEET OR SO BELOW WHICH APPEARED TO BE APPROACHING US AND VARYING IT'S ALTITUDE UP AND DOWN. THE LIGHT COULD HAVE BEEN A SUN REFLECTION.  I TOLD THE STUDENT TO LOOK UP TO WATCH THE OBJECT ALSO AS WE TURNED AWAY FROM IT. WE QUERIED FAY TRACON AND THEY DID NOT SEE ANY CONFLICTING TRAFFIC. IT DID NOT APPEAR ON TIS (TRAFFIC INFORMATION SERVICES) NOR ON IPAD ADS-B (AUTOMATIC DEPENDENT SURVEILLANCE-BROADCAST).  WHEN WE TOOK EVASIVE ACTION IN TURNING TOWARD THE VOR (CONTINUING IN THE HOLD) WE LOST VISUAL CONTACT AND NEVER SAW IT AGAIN.  AS A MATTER OF NOTE THERE IS A KNOWN MODEL AIRCRAFT FIELD APPROXIMATELY 6 MILES EAST OF THE VOR.,An instructor flying near the SDZ VOR at 3;300 feet took evasive action from a UAV which FAY TRACON did not have on radar.,2015,06
57,201506,TEXAS,WE WERE OPERATING A REVENUE FLIGHT TO DAL. APPROACHING DAL FROM THE SOUTH WE WERE SEQUENCED FOR A VISUAL APPROACH ON A RIGHT DOWNWIND TO RUNWAY 13L. AS I WAS TURNING DOWNWIND TO BASE LEG THE TOWER ADVISED US THAT A DRONE WAS SEEN OPERATING ON THE FINAL APPROACH FOR RUNWAY 13L AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 FEET AND 1 MILE FROM THE RUNWAY. THE TOWER CONTROLLER ASKED IF WE WOULD BE ABLE TO SIDESTEP TO RUNWAY 13R AS THERE WAS A [LAW ENFORCEMENT] HELICOPTER OPERATING ON THE 13L FINAL SEARCHING FOR THE DRONE. I INSTRUCTED MY FIRST OFFICER TO ACKNOWLEDGE IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND I MANEUVERED TO LAND RUNWAY 13R AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT.  WE DID OBSERVE THE [LAW ENFORCEMENT] HELICOPTER BUT NOT THE DRONE.,A flight crew on final to DAL Runway 13L were advised of a drone on final at 1;000 feet and sidestepped to 13R. They detected the helicopter investigating the drone; but did not see the drone.,2015,06
58,201506,TEXAS,ON FINAL APPROACH INTO DALLAS 13L; I SAW A DARK OBJECT PASS THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. I ASKED THE FIRST OFFICER IF WE PASSED A BIRD OR A BALLOON; AND HE SAID IT LOOKED LIKE A DRONE. HE PASSED ONTO TOWER WHAT HE SAW; AND WE LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. IT DID NOT AFFECT THE APPROACH OR LANDING. THE OBSERVER IN THE JUMPSEAT CONFIRMED WHAT THE FIRST OFFICER SAW.,Airline flight crew reports sighting a drone at 1;000 feet during approach to DAL Runway 13L.,2015,06
59,201506,TEXAS,ON THE DFW HRPER DEPARTURE TWO HOURS AFTER SUNRISE; AT ABOUT 9000 FEET; THE FIRST OFFICER ASKED IF I SAW AN OBJECT GO BY AT CLOSE RANGE.  I DID NOT.  I ASKED HIM IF IT WAS AN AIRPLANE.  HE SAID NO.  I ASKED IF IT WAS A BALLOON.  HE SAID NO.  I ASKED IF IT WAS A DRONE.  HE SAID IT COULD BE.  HE THEN NOTIFIED ATC.  THE FLIGHT CONTINUED UNEVENTFULLY.,An air carrier aircraft departed on the DFW HRPER2 Departure (RNAV) mid-morning and at 9;000 feet the First Officer saw an object believed to be a drone pass by at a close range. The flying Captain did not take evasive action.,2015,06
60,201506,WISCONSIN,THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME INTO LSE. AFTER RECEIVING AND ACKNOWLEDGING TAXI INSTRUCTIONS AND WHILE TAXIING TO RWY 36 FOR DEPARTURE I PASSED THE HOLD SHORT LINE WITHOUT STOPPING.  THE CONTROLLER CALLED SAYING THAT I HAD PASSED THE HOLD SHORT POINT AT WHICH POINT I STOPPED.  HE ASKED IF I WOULD BE READY FOR TAKEOFF SOON TO WHICH I REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE; HE THEN CLEARED ME FOR TAKEOFF.I WAS USING AN EXPANSION OF THE SMALL FORE-FLIGHT AIRPORT DIAGRAM ON THE LSE HOME PAGE RATHER THAN THE LARGER DIAGRAM ASSOCIATED WITH THE TAXIWAYS BUTTON. THAT DIAGRAM HAS A HS-1 BALLOON IN THE LOCATION WHERE THE PROBLEM OCCURRED.  WHEN I WENT PAST THE HOLD-SHORT MARKINGS I REMEMBER THINKING THE HOLD-SHORT WAS FOR RWY 4 AND THAT SINCE IT WAS SO FAR FROM RWY 36 THAT THERE WOULD BE ANOTHER HOLD SHORT AREA FOR THAT RUNWAY.  HAD I BEEN USING THE LARGER AIRPORT TAXI DIAGRAM I DON'T BELIEVE I WOULD HAVE MADE THIS ERROR.,PA-28 pilot reports not recognizing the Runway 36 (and Runway 4) hold line on taxiway F at LSE and continues on to taxiway E. ATC notes the incursion.,2015,06
61,201507,ARIZONA,FLYING THE BRUSR 1 ARRIVAL FOR RUNWAY 26 INTO PHX; AND A FOUR-POD DRONE WAS SPOTTED IN FRONT OF OUR AIRCRAFT MOVING RIGHT TO LEFT. CONTINUE TO REPORT HIGH FLYING DRONES IN THE VICINITY OF ALL AIRPORTS AND GIVE FULL DETAIL TO ATC OF ITS CURRENT LOCATION; AND DESCRIPTION.,Air Carrier flight crew report a four pod drone in the vicinity of their aircraft while on final for Runway 26 at PHX.,2015,07
62,201507,ARIZONA,WHILE FLYING WESTBOUND APPROXIMATELY 8 MILES NORTH OF P03 AT 8500 FEET MSL WE ENCOUNTERED A SMALL GREY UAV (POSSIBLY A HUNTER) FOLLOWED BY AIRCRAFT Z ACTING AS CHASE. UAV WAS SLIGHTLY BELOW US AND CROSSED IN FRONT OF US FROM LEFT TO RIGHT. AIRCRAFT Z CROSSED UNDERNEATH US. COLLISION AVOIDANCE WAS TAKEN BY CLIMBING AND TURNING TO THE SOUTHWEST. APPROXIMATELY 8 MINUTES PRIOR TO THE EVENT I CALLED ON CTAF 122.8 OF OUR LOCATION OVER P03 AND RECEIVED NO RESPONSE. AFTER SEEING THE UAV AND AIRCRAFT Z I CALLED ONCE AGAIN ON 122.8 AND NO ANSWER WAS RECEIVED. THE UAV AND AIRCRAFT Z CONTINUED TO THE NORTH AND NO CHANGE IN ALTITUDE OR DIRECTION WAS SEEN.,Pilot took evasive action to avoid a UAV and the chase airplane behind it at 8;500 FT near a local airport.,2015,07
63,201507,CALIFORNIA,TURNING FINAL FOR RUNWAY 27 AT SAN; ABEAM CIJHI; AT APPROXIMATELY 4000 FT MSL; I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A DRONE/UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV); FLY DIRECTLY ACROSS MY NOSE WITHIN 100 FT VERTICAL AND 100 FT HORIZONTAL. THE VEHICLE WAS SILVER IN COLOR; SHINY ON THE RIGHT AND APPEARED TO BE IN THE SHAPE OF AN 'H'; WITH THE CENTER PORTION BEING LONGER THAN THE EDGES. I ESTIMATE THE ENTIRE VEHICLE WAS 12-24 INCHES LONG AND POSSIBLY HAD PROPS ON THE LEFT AND RIGHT EDGES. THE VEHICLE WAS MOVING FROM MY LEFT TO MY RIGHT; HEADING SOUTH TO NORTH. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED IT OUT TO MY CAPTAIN; BUT THE GLARE-SHIELD KEPT HIM FROM SEEING IT. I DID NOT HAVE TO MANEUVER TO AVOID THE UAV; AS IT PASSED OFF MY RIGHT SIDE AND I HAD ALREADY ESTABLISHED A CLEAR LINE OF SIGHT. I LANDED UNEVENTFULLY AT SAN; UPON LANDING; I REPORTED THE UAV AND CLOSE PASS TO ATC WITH THE SAME DESCRIPTION AS ABOVE. SAN DIEGO GROUND INFORMED ME THAT ANOTHER CARRIER AIRCRAFT HAD JUST REPORTED THE SAME UAV TRAFFIC AND NEAR MISS ON THEIR LANDING JUST MINUTES PRIOR TO OUR ARRIVAL. I SPOKE WITH COMPANY FLIGHT SAFETY AND GAVE MY REPORT. NO DAMAGE WAS TAKEN TO COMPANY EQUIPMENT AND NO PASSENGERS WERE AFFECTED BY THE INCIDENT.,Air carrier First Officer reports a NMAC with a drone at 4;000 feet during approach to SAN.,2015,07
64,201507,CALIFORNIA,ON FINAL PHASE OF A FLIGHT TO TVL. ON 3-MILE FINAL APPROACH TO TAXIWAY A AT TVL FROM THE WEST (ECHO SUMMIT); 36 HEADING. AT APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILES FROM THE APPROACH END OF TAXIWAY A; I OBSERVED A CROWD OF APPROXIMATELY 6 PEOPLE ON THE RAMP JUST ACROSS THE GRASS STRIP/DITCH FROM THE WEST SIDE OF TAXIWAY ALPHA; NEAR THE INTERSECTION WITH F. SINCE THE TAXIWAY ITSELF WAS CLEAR; AND MY TOUCHDOWN POINT WAS BEYOND THAT INTERSECTION; I CONTINUED THE APPROACH; WITH CAUTION; AND LANDED NEAR OUR HANGAR AT THE NORTH END OF THE FIELD. WE HAD BEEN IN CONTACT WITH OAKLAND CENTER FOR THE LAST SEGMENT OF OUR FLIGHT (FROM APPROXIMATELY JAQ TO ECHO SUMMIT); AND WERE NOT ADVISED OF ANY UNUSUAL HAZARDS IN THE TVL AIRSPACE. WE HAD SELF-ANNOUNCED ON THE TVL CTAF AT SEVERAL POINTS DURING THE FINAL APPROACH; AND HEARD NO RESPONSE.AFTER LANDING; MY PASSENGER AND I WENT TO THE TVL TERMINAL; AND TALKED TO MR. X; ONE OF THE FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS AT [AN AREA HELICOPTER FLYING CLUB]. I LEARNED THAT A DRONE HAD BEEN FLYING OVER THE TAXIWAY; DIRECTLY IN OUR APPROACH PATH; APPROXIMATELY 2-3 MINUTES BEFORE WE ARRIVED. IT WOULD HAVE POSED A SERIOUS COLLISION RISK FOR US; BUT HAD IN FACT CRASHED INTO A PRIVATE JET PARKED ON THE RAMP JUST AS WE ARRIVED. HE HAD CELL PHONE VIDEO OF THE DRONE FLIGHT. I TOLD HIM THAT WE HAD BEEN TALKING TO OAKLAND CENTER; AND HAD RECEIVED NO ADVISORIES; AND ASKED IF HE KNEW WHETHER THE OPERATORS HAD PERMISSION FROM OAKLAND. HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD CALLED OAKLAND; AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD NOT BEEN INFORMED. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT THE DRONE OPERATORS HAD BEEN TAKING PHOTOS FOR COMPENSATION; AND HAD TOLD HIM THAT THEY HAD RECEIVED PERMISSION TO OPERATE FROM THE AIRPORT MANAGER. HOWEVER; I DOUBT THAT THIS REPRESENTS SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY; AND I KNOW FROM MY OWN OBSERVATION THAT THE OPERATORS WERE NOT OBSERVING THE MOST SIMPLE SAFETY PRECAUTIONS SUCH AS MONITORING AND COMMUNICATING ON THE CTAF FREQUENCY.IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THE NEW RULES GOVERNING UNMANNED DRONE FLIGHTS FOR COMMERCIAL PURPOSES PROHIBIT FLIGHTS NEAR AIRPORTS WITHOUT SPECIFIC AUTHORIZATION FROM THE FAA. SINCE THE OPERATION OF THIS DRONE IN THAT AREA POSED A SERIOUS RISK OF MID-AIR COLLISION ; SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE TO OUR AIRCRAFT; AND MORTAL RISK TO MYSELF AND MY PASSENGERS; I VIEW THIS AS A VERY SERIOUS INCIDENT. I AM HOPING THAT THE FAA CAN FOLLOW UP; AND TAKE ANY ACTION REQUIRED TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE.,A helicopter pilot reported a commercial UAV operating over CTAF TVL taxiways apparently with a local authority's permission.,2015,07
65,201507,CALIFORNIA,AIRCRAFT X [A UAV] DEPARTED BAB AND BEGAN A NORMAL CLIMB OUT TO FL190 ON THEIR FILED ROUTE OF FLIGHT. AS AIRCRAFT X WAS LEAVING APPROXIMATELY 140 THE PILOT REQUESTED A LEFT 360. I RESPONDED WITH 'PROCEED AS REQUESTED' AND RESTATED TO MAINTAIN FL190. AS AIRCRAFT X WAS ABOUT HALFWAY INTO THE UNPLANNED TURN THE PILOT ASKED IF THEY COULD REJOIN THEIR FILED ROUTE OF FLIGHT AND CLIMB TO FL510 BLOCK FL590. I RESPONDED WITH 'PROCEED AS REQUESTED' AND DID NOT RESTATE THE ALTITUDE TO MAINTAIN. AT THAT POINT AIRCRAFT X REJOINED THE FILED ROUTE OF FLIGHT AND BEGAN A CLIMB INTO ZOA AIRSPACE WITHOUT COORDINATION OR COMMUNICATIONS TRANSFER AS THE AIRCRAFT X PILOT MISSED THE FREQUENCY CHANGE.I FAILED TO RESTATE THE ALTITUDE TO MAINTAIN ON THE SECOND 'PROCEED AS REQUESTED' INSTRUCTION. ADDITIONALLY I WILL REFRAIN FROM USING 'PROCEED AS REQUESTED' WITH IFR AIRCRAFT AS IT CAN LEAD TO CONFUSION. I DON'T USUALLY USE THAT PHRASEOLOGY WITH IFR AIRCRAFT; BUT I FELT THAT THE PILOT WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED AND THAT GIVING THEM LESS COMPLICATED INSTRUCTIONS WOULD BE MORE EXPEDITIOUS. IN THIS CASE IT LED TO CONFUSION WITH THE ALTITUDE AND AN AIRSPACE VIOLATION OCCURRED.,NCT Controller reports of an aircraft that requested a 360 turn. The Controller used the term 'Proceed as requested.' The aircraft did and while halfway through the turn the pilot requested to rejoin the flight plan and climb to a higher than assigned block altitude. Controller again used the term; 'Proceed as requested;' but forgot to restate the altitude to maintain. Aircraft climbed through uncoordinated airspace leading to an airspace violation by the NCT Controller.,2015,07
66,201507,CALIFORNIA,I WAS ACTING AS A CFI ON A TRAINING FLIGHT WITH A STUDENT RETURNING TO OUR HOME BASE PAO WHEN WE FLEW PAST A DRONE IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN.  MY STUDENT WAS FLYING.  WE WERE ENTERING THE LEFT DOWNWIND FOR RUNWAY 31 AT PAO FROM A STANDARD 45 DEGREE ENTRY WHEN I SPOTTED AN UNMANNED DRONE 2-3 FEET IN SIZE AT OUR ALTITUDE; WHICH WAS THE STANDARD LEFT PATTERN ALTITUDE FOR 31 AT PAO.  WE PASSED WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET OF THE DRONE AND TOOK NO EVASIVE ACTION.  IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING WITH NO DISCERNIBLE MOTION.  MY STUDENT INDICATED THAT HE DID NOT SEE IT.  THERE WERE NO PRIOR TRAFFIC ADVISORIES FROM PAO TOWER OR PAO ATIS REGARDING THE DRONE OR DRONE ACTIVITY IN THE AREA.  I REPORTED THE DRONE TO PAO TOWER AND TOWER MADE A BROADCAST TO ALL AIRCRAFT OF OUR DRONE REPORT.BY THE TIME I SAW THE DRONE AND RECOGNIZED IT AS SUCH; WE HAD NEARLY FLOWN PAST IT.  SUCH A SMALL VEHICLE IS DIFFICULT TO SPOT UNTIL VERY CLOSE IN.  I USUALLY FOCUS ON TRAFFIC SCANNING AT DISTANCES THAT ARE FURTHER AWAY.  I HAD RECENTLY ATTENDED A MEETING AT PAO FOR CFIS WHERE REPORTS OF NEARBY DRONE ACTIVITY WAS MENTIONED AND I THINK THIS HELPED ME RECOGNIZE IT AS A DRONE MORE QUICKLY.  SOME PILOT AWARENESS OF LOCAL DRONE ACTIVITY MAY HELP FACILITATE CLOSE-IN VISUAL SCANNING AND FASTER RECOGNITION OF THESE SMALL VEHICLES.    LEGISLATION REQUIRING FIRMWARE IN THESE COMMERCIALLY MANUFACTURED DRONES THAT PREVENTS OPERATION OUTSIDE OF THE FAA LIMITS WOULD IMPROVE SAFETY.  THE DISTRIBUTION OF INFORMATION TO DRONE PURCHASERS REGARDING LOCAL FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS; AIRPORT LOCATIONS; ETC. MAY ALSO HELP PREVENT THIS INCIDENT FROM OCCURRING. TO PUT THIS EVENT INTO SOME CONTEXT; BIRD ACTIVITY ALSO CREATES HAZARDS AT PAO AND I HAVE HAD SEVERAL NEAR COLLISIONS WITH BIRDS THERE AND ELSEWHERE FLYING OVER MANY YEARS.  HOWEVER; BIRDS USUALLY DIVE OUT OF THE WAY WHILE THE DRONE DID NOT.  THIS DRONE ALSO LIKELY WEIGHED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE THAN A BIRD.,An instructor with his flying student was entering a 45 degree left downwind for PAO Runway 31 at 1;000 FT when he detected a UAV about 2-3 FT wide; approximately 100 FT beneath his aircraft.,2015,07
67,201507,GEORGIA,WHILE ON A VISUAL APPROACH TO RWY 27L; WE ENCOUNTERED AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE. THE EVENT OCCURRED ON APPROXIMATELY A THREE MILE FINAL. OUR ALTITUDE WAS APPROXIMATELY 2200 FEET MSL; AND THE UAV WAS 500 FEET BELOW US AND SLIGHTLY OFF TO THE CAPTAIN'S SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE CLOSURE RATE WAS FAR TOO FAST FOR US TO TAKE ANY EVASIVE ACTION. WE CONTINUED THE APPROACH AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. WE REPORTED THE EVENT TO THE TOWER CONTROLLER. DURING THE TAXI-IN; ATC REQUESTED INFORMATION ABOUT THE INCIDENT. THE VEHICLE APPEARED TO HAVE SOME SORT OF DISK IN THE CENTER; WITH ROTORS/PROPELLERS ON THE CORNERS.UPON LANDING AND DEPLANING; A [COMPANY EMPLOYEE] MET ME AT THE AIRCRAFT AND REQUESTED THAT I CALL A PHONE NUMBER. I CALLED THE NUMBER FROM THE TELEPHONE IN THE JETBRIDGE.,An air carrier Captain on a visual approach to ATL at 2;200 feet encountered an UAS about 500 feet below his aircraft on a three mile final. The encounter was so brief no evasive action was taken.,2015,07
68,201507,INDIANA,VISIT TO SUPPORT EVENT. NOTAMS CHECKED; NONE PUBLISHED. TFR'S CHECKED; NONE PUBLISHED. CVG ATC QUERIED; NO RESTRICTIONS. IMS UNICOM QUERIED; NO KNOWN RESTRICTIONS.OBSERVED HELICOPTER ON APPROACH; MONITORED LANDING UNTIL ROTOR STOPPED. FOLLOWED HELICOPTER APPROACH PATH TO A WATER LANDING 2 MILES DOWNSTREAM BEYOND COAST GUARD FLOATING RESTRICTION MARKERS. RIVER WAS OPEN TO BOAT TRAFFIC; [EVENT] NOT RUNNING AT THIS TIME. 4-5 KNOT CURRENT DICTATED DOWNSTREAM LANDING. 5 KNOT HEADWIND DICTATED UPSTREAM TAKEOFF. MANEUVERED FOR ALTITUDE ON CLIMB OUT AND AVOIDED BRIDGE AND POWER PLANT; FOLLOWED SAME PATH OUT OF AREA. RECEIVED PHONE CALL FROM INDIANAPOLIS FAA THAT THEY HAD A TEST DRONE PROGRAM AND FAA INSPECTOR ON SITE; COAST GUARD HAD CALLED FAA. DRONE PROGRAM AND FLIGHT SERVICE CHECKED FOR NOTAMS IN ARREARS FOR IMS AND IIU VOR NOTAMS. LOCAL SEAPLANE OPERATOR NOT NOTIFIED OF DRONE PROGRAM. DRONES RESTRICTED TO 200 FEET BY FAA. AT NO TIME WERE WE BELOW 500 FEET OVER [EVENT] COURSE. NO KNOWN CONFLICTS.,Prior to takeoff; seaplane crew noticed a small airborne helicopter. Crew waited until helicopter had completed a water landing before taking off. Crew later learned that the craft was part of an FAA test drone program and that the local seaplane operator had not been notified.,2015,07
69,201507,NEW MEXICO,I WAS WORKING SECTOR 65 (340B999) WITH QUITE A BIT OF WEATHER AND LAX 20 MIT. AIRCRAFT X WAS AT FL390 FILED BLH.J65.PXR...; PUTTING THEM ON A ROUTE DUE WEST OF PHX TRAVELING EASTBOUND. OVER KOFFA INTERSECTION; THE PILOT REPORTED PASSING A BALLOON AT ABOUT THEIR ALTITUDE. THEY SAID IT WAS A SCIENTIFIC BALLOON WITH A PAYLOAD. THEY DIDN'T SEE IT UNTIL THEY WERE PASSING IT AND SAID THEY PASSED IT VERY QUICKLY. THEY SAID THEY WERE CLOSE ENOUGH TO IT THAT THEY COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE LANYARD EXTENDING FROM THE BALLOON TO THE PAYLOAD. THEY ESTIMATED THEY PASSED WITHIN 1000 FEET OF THE BALLOON. I VECTORED EVERYONE ELSE SOUTH OF THE BALLOON'S REPORTED LOCATION. I HAD ANOTHER AIRCRAFT HEADING TO A FIX SOUTH OF KOFFA AND THEY SAID THEY SAW THE BALLOON ABOUT FIVE MILES AWAY AT ABOUT FL365; PUTTING IT IN ABOUT THE SAME LOCATION OF KOFFA. NO ONE ELSE SAW THE BALLOON; BUT I PROBABLY VECTORED ABOUT HALF DOZEN AIRCRAFT SOUTH OF KOFFA SINCE THE WIND WAS HEADING NORTHBOUND. I WAS FAIRLY BUSY WITH WEATHER DEVIATIONS; THOUGH I ABANDONED TRYING TO GET THE 20 MIT TO LAX SINCE I WAS BUSY AND NONE OF THE FLOWS WERE WORKING ANYWAYS. WHEN I TOLD THE FLMS (THERE WERE TWO; ONE BEING RELIEVED); THEY SAID THEY KNEW NOTHING ABOUT IT. I ASSUME THEY REPORTED IT TO THE OM TO DO AN MOR; BUT I DIDN'T HEAR ANYTHING AGAIN AFTER I LEFT.I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE FARS SAY ABOUT BALLOONS; BUT NOTIFICATION INTO THE PCA SHOULD BE A PREREQUISITE. IF IT ISN'T; THE FARS NEED TO BE CHANGED.,ZAB Controller reports of a balloon sighting reported by a pilot. Controller issues unknown traffic and tries to avoid the area with the balloon for other traffic. Controller reports information to the Front Line Manager.,2015,07
70,201507,NEW YORK,I (PF) BRIEFED THE LENDY6 ARRIVAL AND VOR/DME RWY 22L APPROACH. CAPTAIN (PM) ASKED 'WHAT IF ATC ASKS FOR VOR 13L?' I TOLD HIM UNABLE; OR HE IS WELCOME TO TAKE THE APPROACH. I CONSIDERED THE VOR 13L A 'CONTACT WITH THE GROUND' APPROACH MOSTLY USED FOR PILOTS FAMILIAR WITH JFK AND THE SURROUNDINGS. I WASN'T COMFORTABLE DOING THIS VISUAL MANEUVER AT THE END OF MY LONG DAY OVER CONGESTED POPULATION INTO A BUSY AIRPORT. HE AGREED AND LET ME CONTINUE WITH THE APPROACH PLANNING VOR/DME 22L.NY CENTER CLEARED US DIRECT TO LENDY AND THE ARRIVAL. AFTER PASSING LENDY AT FL190 AND 250K; SWITCHED TO KENNEDY APPROACH (RADIOS WERE BUSY; BUT NOT OVERLY CONGESTED) WHO SAID 'CLEARED DIRECT TO LGA FOR VOR 13L APPROACH'. PM REPLIED 'UNABLE' (WE MEANT 'UNABLE FOR THE VOR13L APPROACH' AND ASSUMED VOR/DME 22L AS IT WAS THE ONLY OTHER APPROACH REPORTED ON THE ATIS; ATC UNDERSTOOD 'UNABLE DIRECT LGA'); ATC GAVE US A HEADING OF ABOUT 120. WE CONTINUED AND CROSSED CLOSE TO THE FIELD CONTINUING SE ABOUT 12;000 FT. WE THEN DISCUSSED IF WE WERE GOING TO GET VECTORS BACK TO THE NORTH FOR RWY 22L. FURTHER DESCENT TO 6000 FT STILL HEADING AWAY FROM THE AIRPORT. I THEN SLOWED TO 210K (ABOUT 15 KNOTS ABOVE THE LOWER FOOT) USING FCP LEVEL CHANGE (SPEED ON PITCH). ABOUT 20 MILES AWAY FROM JFK OVER THE OCEAN; ANOTHER DESCENT TO 3000 FT; AT THIS TIME WE DIDN'T KNOW WHICH RUNWAY WE WERE GETTING VECTORED FOR. PM ASKED ATC WHICH RUNWAY TO EXPECT; ATC REPLIED VOR 13L. WE REPLIED WE WERE UNABLE AND STATED THAT AT CHECK-IN.ATC GOT A LITTLE FRANTIC AND DIRECTED US TO A LEFT TURN HEADING NORTHEAST; FOLLOWED QUICKLY BY DIRECTIONS TO ANOTHER AIRCRAFT (PRESUMABLY CLOSE-BY) TO STOP DESCENT AT 5000 FT (OUR ALTITUDE). ATC THEN TOLD US 'GOOD RATE OF TURN; TRAFFIC DESCENDING TO 5000 FT.' BEING UNDER CONTROL OF THE SITUATION AND WITH GOOD S/A ABOUT THE AIRSPACE (AND MAYBE OVER-CONFIDENCE IN MY AIRMANSHIP); I DISCONNECTED THE AP AND MADE A 30-40 DEGREE BANK TURN WHILE STILL DESCENDING. THE PROBLEM WAS THE FMA WAS STILL IN A 'SPEED ON PITCH' PROFILE WITH THE THROTTLES CLAMPED AT IDLE! HALF WAY THRU THE TURN; I NOTICED THE AIRSPEED HAD DECAYED TO 15 KNOTS BELOW THE FOOT! I QUICKLY DIALED UP THE VERTICAL SPEED TO GET THE FMA OUT OF 'SPEED ON PITCH' AND BACK TO 'SPEED ON THRUST' (PREVIOUSLY SELECTED AT 210K) THEN IMMEDIATELY PUSHED THE THROTTLES UP A LOT! ABOUT THE SAME TIME; THE PM SAID 'AIRSPEED' AND FOLLOWED THE BASE OF THE THROTTLES UP BEHIND MY INPUT. I SHALLOWED OUT OF THE TURN (DIDN'T WANT TO GET INTO STICK-SHAKER OR STALL) AS THE ENGINES SPOOLED UP. THE PM DIRECTED ME TO CONTINUE MY DESCENT TO 3000 FT. AFTER SETTLING THE PLANE ON OUR NORTHEAST HEADING AT 3000 FT AND OVER 220K; I ENSURED THE FCP WAS PROGRAMMED TO WHAT I WANTED AND ENGAGED THE AP. ONCE SEPARATION WAS ESTABLISHED; ATC WAS BACK TO NORMAL SPEED OF INSTRUCTIONS; IT DIDN'T APPEAR THIS WOULD BE AN INCIDENT ON THEIR PART.THE TONE ON THE FLIGHT DECK CHANGED; AND TO GET CRM BACK I STATED 'I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT; I'M RECAGED AGAIN' AND SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF 'DO YOU WANT ME TO CONTINUE OR DO YOU WANT TO TAKE IT FROM HERE?' PM TOLD ME TO CONTINUE FLYING. VECTORS TO VOR/DME 22L AND LANDING WERE WITHOUT INCIDENT. THOROUGH DEBRIEF AFTERWARDS. I WAS VERY UPSET WITH MYSELF!1) DISCONNECT WITH OUR CALL 'UNABLE' MEANING UNABLE VOR 13L AND ATC'S UNDERSTANDING OF OUR CALL; HE THOUGHT 'UNABLE DIRECT LGA' BUT STILL VECTORING US TO VOR 13L.2) WE SHOULD HAVE ENSURED WHICH APPROACH TO EXPECT AS WE STARTED HEADING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION FROM VOR/DME 22L APPROACH. RADIOS WERE BUSY BUT WE STILL COULD'VE ASKED THE CONTROLLER.3) ONCE ATC KNEW OUR INTENTIONS; HE COULD'VE LET US DRONE A BIT MORE VS. TELLING US TO TURN LEFT HEADING NE IMMEDIATELY; AND THEN DISCOVERED WE MIGHT BE A CONFLICT WITH OTHER TRAFFIC.4) ATC'S FRUSTRATION AND 'GOOD RATE OF TURN' SHOULDN'T HAVE PROMPTED ME TO DISCONNECT THE AP AND MAKE AN AGGRESSIVE MANEUVER. THERE WAS THE PLANE WAS PERFORMING NORMALLY.5) I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE AWARE OF THE 'SPEED ON PITCH' FMA AND HAD THE AIRSPEED IN MY CROSS-CHECK. FLYING WITH AUTO-THROTTLES ALWAYS ENGAGED GAVE ME A FALSE CONFIDENCE THAT THE AIRSPEED WAS BEING MONITORED.,First Officer disconnected the autopilot and allowed the speed to decay significantly while being vectored for an approach to JFK VOR/DME Runway 22L after refusing the VOR Runway 13L. The autothrottles were engaged but were at idle in 'speed on pitch' mode rather than 'speed on thrust.',2015,07
71,201507,NEW YORK,DURING THE HAND-OFF TO FINAL APPROACH CONTROLLER WE WERE ADVISED THE PREVIOUS AIRCRAFT HAD SIGHTED A UAV IN THE VICINITY OF DIALS WHILE ON THE VISUAL APPROACH TO RWY 31. WE WERE TOLD THE UAV WAS BELOW AND TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE FLIGHT PATH. THE FIRST OFFICER BEGAN TO LOOK OUTSIDE FOR THE UAV. APPROXIMATELY 1.5 MILES PRIOR TO DIALS HE SAW A UAV. UAV WAS:100-200 FT OFF THE RIGHT WING50-100 FT ABOVE THE AIRCRAFT (AIRCRAFT WAS AT 2;500 FT)SHAPE: RECTANGULARSIZE: APPROXIMATELY 2 FT LONGCOLOR: SILVER/WHITECONFIGURATION: 2 PROPELLER AREAS - FRONT AND BACKWE ADVISED THE FINAL APPROACH CONTROLLER AND THE LGA TOWER OF ALL THE DETAILS.,B737 Captain reports a NMAC with a UAV at 2;500 feet near DIALS during the Expressway Visual Approach to LGA.,2015,07
72,201507,NORTH CAROLINA,WE WERE ON A VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 23 AT CHARLOTTE; JUST INSIDE LECAR.  FIRST OFFICER (FO) WAS THE PILOT FLYING.  I NOTICED AN OBJECT OUTSIDE MY LEFT SIDE WINDOW.  AT FIRST I FIGURED IT WAS A BALLOON OR A BIRD.  I REALIZED IT WAS A DRONE; MAROON AND SILVER IN COLOR; AND I WOULD ESTIMATE ITS DISTANCE FROM OUR PLANE HORIZONTALLY AT BETWEEN 100-200 FEET. FO SAYS HE LOOKED AT THE RADIO ALTIMETER AND WE WERE AT 1250 FEET AGL AT THE TIME OF SIGHTING.  WE WERE FOLLOWING THE GLIDE PATH DOWN FOR RUNWAY 23 AND WE WERE ON CENTERLINE OF THE LOCALIZER. WE REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO CLT TOWER. UPON LANDING WE WERE GIVEN A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL TO GIVE MORE INFORMATION ON THE DETAILS WE SAW.,Air carrier Captain reports sighting a drone pass 100-200 feet off the left wing during the approach to CLT at 1;250 feet AGL.,2015,07
73,201507,OHIO,MYSELF AND TWO CLOSE FRIENDS FLEW TO BKL FOR THE DAY TO [ATTEND AN EVENT]. AFTER ARRIVING BACK AT THE AIRPORT; I PAID FOR THE FUEL; DID MY PREFLIGHT INSPECTION; GOT THE ATIS (WHICH MADE NO MENTION OF ANY TFR IN EFFECT); SPOKE TO GROUND (WHO ALSO MADE NO MENTION OF A TFR); WHO THEN HANDED ME OFF TO TOWER (WHO ALSO MADE NO MENTION OF A TFR IN EFFECT OVER THE AIRPORT FROM SURFACE TO 3;000 FEET AGL).AFTER RECEIVING CLEARANCE FOR TAKEOFF AND A LEFT HAND TURN TOWARDS MY DESTINATION; I ASKED THE CONTROLLER FOR PERMISSION TO CIRCLE MOMENTARILY AROUND A LOCAL YACHT CLUB WHICH WAS APPROXIMATELY TWO MILES WEST OF THE AIRPORT. HE REPLIED THAT IT WAS 'UP TO ME.' WHILE OVER LAKE ERIE; APPROXIMATELY HALF A MILE FROM SHORE; I DESCENDED TO 800 FEET AGL SO MY PASSENGERS COULD TAKE A PHOTO OF THE YACHT CLUB. AT THAT MOMENT I HEARD A TRANSMISSION FROM AN UNIDENTIFIED SOURCE (EITHER THE TOWER OR ANOTHER AIRCRAFT ON THE FREQUENCY) INFORMING ME THAT I WAS IN AN ACTIVE TFR. I IMMEDIATELY STARTED A CLIMBING RIGHTHAND TURN OUT OVER THE LAKE TO GET OUT OF IT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. FOLLOWING THAT; I REQUESTED FOR A FREQUENCY CHANGE; AND CONTACTED CLEVELAND APPROACH; WHO GAVE ME A TRANSPONDER CODE AND INITIATED FLIGHT FOLLOWING TO THE DESTINATION.THE MAIN CONTRIBUTING FACTORS WERE THAT I HAD NOT RECEIVED AN ADEQUATE PREFLIGHT VFR BRIEFING. I UNDERSTAND THAT FAR 91.103 STATES THAT I MUST BECOME FAMILIAR WITH ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION FOR THE FLIGHT. WE WERE IN A HURRY TO GET HOME AND I KNEW IT WOULD BE VMC THE ENTIRE FLIGHT; SO I OMITTED A PREFLIGHT BRIEFING; AND AS A RESULT; I DEPARTED FROM A CONTROLLED AIRPORT THAT WAS UNDER A TFR.,A C172 pilot reports departing BKL and discovering airborne that the airport is under a TFR. There was no mention of the TFR on ATIS; Ground; or Tower. The NOTAMS were not checked.,2015,07
74,201507,TEXAS,I WAS GIVEN FALSE INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE I COULD FLY MY DRONE. I WAS TOLD I WOULD BE OKAY IF I WAS 2 MILES AWAY FROM THE AIRPORT AND UNDER 400 FEET.  I FLEW MY DROWN 2.6 MILES AWAY FROM CLL AIRPORT IN COLLEGE STATION TX.  ALTHOUGH I WAS UNDER THE 400 FEET LIMIT I WAS WITHIN THE 5 MILE LIMITS. I WAS INFORMED ABOUT MY MISTAKE BY THE MANAGER OF THE AIRPORT AND WAS RECOMMENDED TO CONTACT ASRS AND REPORT MY PROBLEM. I WAS ALSO GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS ON WHAT TO DO IN THE FUTURE IF I WANTED TO FLY MY DRONE AROUND THE AREA.,A private individual reported being advised by the CLL Airport Manager that he should cease flying his drone below 400 FT within 2.6 miles of the airport.,2015,07
75,201507,VIRGINIA,MY PASSENGER; WHO IS PRIVATE PILOT RATED; OBSERVED A SMALL FLYING OBJECT; POSSIBLY A DRONE; IN THE ONE O'CLOCK LOW POSITION. THE COLOR WAS RED AND SILVER WITH AN ELONGATED BODY SHAPE. THE SIGHTING ONLY LASTED 3 TO 5 SECONDS. ATC WAS THEN QUERIED APPROXIMATELY 2 MINUTES AFTER THE SIGHTING IF THERE WAS ANY TRAFFIC IN THE VICINITY OF OUR AIRCRAFT. THE CONTROLLER ADVISED THERE WAS NONE. WE DID THEN ADVISE ATC OF OUR ENCOUNTER.,Pilot reported a UAS in the vicinity of his aircraft and reported the encounter to ATC.,2015,07
76,201508,ARIZONA,I WAS THE FIRST OFFICER ON FLIGHT INBOUND TO PHX.  WE WERE AT 7000 FT/210 KTS ON THE BRUSR1 RNAV ARRIVAL.  JUST APPROACHING KUCOO INTERSECTION I NOTICED A BLACK; SMALL OBJECT STRAIGHT AHEAD COMING TOWARD THE AIRCRAFT.  AT ROUGHLY 100 FT BELOW US; IT PASSED DIRECTLY UNDER THE NOSE HEADED NORTHBOUND.  THE UNMANNED AIRCRAFT WAS HELICOPTER LIKE. THE DRONE WAS BLACK AND BRIGHT YELLOW WITH A BLACK BUBBLE TOP.  FROM THE SHORT LOOK I HAD; I THINK IT WAS POSSIBLY 1 1/2 FT LONG.  THE CAPTAIN AND JUMPSEATER DID NOT SEE THE DRONE.  I NOTIFIED ATC OF THE SIGHTING AND WE LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT.  UPON ARRIVAL AT THE GATE; WE SPOKE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND I CONTACTED PHOENIX APPROACH CONTROL AS REQUESTED.I DON'T KNOW WHAT CAN BE DONE; BUT I WILL SAY THIS WAS A VERY DISTURBING INCIDENT.  HAD OUR AIRCRAFT BEEN DESCENDING; IT COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN STRUCK; POSSIBLY IN THE WINDSHIELD.  I HOPE MEASURES CAN BE TAKEN TO PREVENT ANOTHER OCCURRENCE.  FROM WHAT I HAVE RESEARCHED TODAY; THE FAA RECEIVES 2 REPORTS A DAY INVOLVING DRONE/AIRCRAFT SIGHTINGS.  THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE AND IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THERE IS AN ACCIDENT.,An air carrier First Officer reported a UAV near miss at 7;000 FT while flying the PHX BRUSR1 Arrival near the KUCOO intersection.,2015,08
77,201508,CALIFORNIA,ON RIGHT DOWNWIND TO RUNWAY 24L AT LAX; AT APPROXIMATELY 2600 FEET AGL FO NOTICED A DRONE AT APPROXIMATELY 3000 FEET AGL ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT.  I DID NOT SEE IT; AND IT POSED NO RISK TO OUR FLIGHT.  FO IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED ATC OF THE DRONE AND ITS LOCATION.  NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS NEEDED; OR TAKEN.  FLIGHT LANDED SAFELY. ONLY CREW ONBOARD.,Business jet Captain reported an encounter with an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV); at approximately 2;600 feet; during initial approach to LAX Runway 24L. No evasive action was required.,2015,08
78,201508,FLORIDA,I WAS PILOT FLYING AND HAD AN UNEVENTFUL FLIGHT UNTIL I APPROACHED THE FLARE ON RUNWAY 12 IN MIA. CAPTAIN WAS NON FLYING PILOT (NFP). AS I BROUGHT THE AIRCRAFT INTO THE FLARE; THE AUTO-THROTTLES RETARDED THE THRUST TO IDLE AS NORMAL. THE CAPTAIN AND I WERE WAITING ON THE MAIN GEAR TO MAKE CONTACT WITH THE RUNWAY AS NORMAL; AS I LISTENED TO THE RADAR ALTIMETER COUNT DOWN FROM 20 AND 10 AT A NORMAL DESCENT RATE. THAT'S WHEN I BEGAN TO EXPERIENCE IRREGULARITY WITH THE AIRCRAFT HANDLING. SUDDENLY; THE LEFT WING DROPPED AGGRESSIVELY CAUSING THE LEFT MAIN GEAR TO SLAM TO THE RUNWAY. THE MOMENTUM FROM THAT IMPACT CAUSED THE AIRCRAFT TO ROLL TO THE RIGHT AND THEN THE RIGHT MAIN MADE FIRM CONTACT WITH THE RUNWAY AS THE LEFT MAIN CAME OFF THE GROUND. AT THAT POINT; I DECIDED THE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT IN CONTROL TO LAND AND I INITIATED A GO-AROUND. HONESTLY; IT HAPPENED SO FAST THAT IN THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT I DON'T REMEMBER IF I HIT THE TOGA BUTTON OR NOT; BUT I MUST HAVE MISSED THE BUTTON BECAUSE I DON'T RECALL THE TOGA THRUST MODE BECOMING ACTIVE. I DID HOWEVER FIREWALL THE THRUST LEVERS BECAUSE OF HOW FAST THE EVENT WAS UNFOLDING; AND THE NEED FOR THRUST IMMEDIATELY. WHILE I WAS ADVANCING THE THROTTLES; THE CAPTAIN CALLED FOR A GO AROUND ALSO. THE AUTO THROTTLES APPEARED TO DISENGAGE FROM MY OVERRIDING INPUT. THE ENGINES WERE AT IDLE ALREADY FROM THE FLARING POSITION THE AIRCRAFT WAS IN; AND IT TOOK ABOUT 5 SECONDS FOR THE ENGINES TO SPOOL UP. IN THE MEAN TIME; THE AIRCRAFT NOSE GEAR MADE CONTACT WITH THE RUNWAY; BUT THE AIRCRAFT SEEMED TO BALLOON BACK OFF THE RUNWAY FROM THE REBOUND. THE AIRPLANE FELT LIKE IT WAS STARTING A PORPOISE-LIKE OSCILLATION. I WAS ABLE TO REGAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE; AND STABILIZED THE AIRCRAFT IN GROUND EFFECT UNTIL THE ENGINES WERE PRODUCING THRUST AND WE STARTED TO CLIMB. FROM THERE; WE WERE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY GO AROUND. WE DEPARTED BACK SOUTHEAST BOUND AND WERE VECTORED FOR A VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 09. I LANDED THE AIRCRAFT WITHOUT INCIDENT AND WE TAXIED TO THE GATE WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. WE DECIDED IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO HAVE MAINTENANCE COME OUT AND INSPECT THE AIRCRAFT FOR A POSSIBLE HARD LANDING. THERE WAS NO SIGN OF VISIBLE AIRCRAFT DAMAGE ON OUR POST FLIGHT INSPECTION. AFTERWARDS; THE CAPTAIN AND I DISCUSSED WHAT HAD HAPPENED A BIT MORE. I EXPLAINED TO THE CAPTAIN I ALL OF A SUDDEN LOST CONTROL OF THE AIRPLANE AS IT SUDDENLY SEEMED TO LOSE LIFT ON THE LEFT WING CAUSING AN ABRUPT AND UNCONTROLLABLE ROLL. WE AGREED WE HAD PROBABLY ENCOUNTERED WAKE TURBULENCE IN THE FLARE. A HEAVY 767 HAD LANDED JUST PRIOR TO OUR ARRIVAL; AND THE ROTATION I EXPERIENCED FELT CONSISTENT WITH WAKE TURBULENCE I'VE EXPERIENCED IN FLIGHT.THERE ISN'T MUCH TO BE SAID ABOUT THE EVENT ITSELF; AS IT WAS NOT PREDICTABLE AND I HAD TO REACT OUT OF INSTINCT TO GET THE AIRPLANE FLYING AGAIN. HOWEVER; THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I EVER HAD A GO-AROUND IN THE AIRPLANE IN THE YEAR AND A HALF I'VE BEEN FLYING FOR [THIS AIRLINE]. THE EVENT ITSELF AND THE GO AROUND WERE A LOT MORE INTENSE THAN I EXPECTED; AND I THINK THAT ADDS TO PART OF THE CONFUSION MY MIND FACED DURING THE EVENT. I THINK I EXPECTED A SUCCESSFUL LANDING; AND THE THOUGHT OF A GO-AROUND HAD NEVER CROSSED MY MIND SO I WASN'T MENTALLY PREPARED FOR HAVING TO DO IT. I WISH NOW LOOKING BACK I HAD SEEN ONE BEFORE IN REAL LIFE; AS IMPRACTICAL IS THAT MAY BE. I ALSO LEARNED TO ALWAYS ANTICIPATE A GO-AROUND FROM A LANDING. EVEN DOWN AS FAR AS 10' ABOVE THE GROUND - IN TRULY THE WORST PLACE I WOULD HAVE TO GO-AROUND; IT COULD HAPPEN. PRACTICING A GO AROUND IN THIS CONDITION MAY BE HELPFUL AS A SIM SCENARIO IN THE FUTURE. ALSO; THE HEAT OF THE MOMENT IN THE GO-AROUND ITSELF. I WOULD HAVE LIKED TO BE MORE 'AUTOMATIC' WITH THE GO AROUND PROCEDURE. I NEED TO REVIEW THAT MENTALLY MORE OFTEN SO WHEN I HAVE TO DO IT AGAIN; I'LL BE COMPLETELY READY TO ACT THAN BE STARTLED. IN THE SIM; I WOULD ALWAYS KNOW WHEN IT WAS COMING. EVEN IF IT DIDN'T HAPPEN; I WAS FRESH AND READY FOR ANYTHING. MOST OF THAT I WOULD SAY IS EXPECTING A SUCCESSFUL LANDING AND AN ERROR ON MY PART; BUT I HAVEN'T DONE A GO-AROUND FOR OVER 6 MONTHS IN ANY CAPACITY. AN SOP REFRESHER IN AQP MIGHT BE A NICE INTEGRATION FOR IRREGULAR OPERATIONS.,ERJ-175 First Officer reported encountering wake turbulence at touchdown in MIA that resulted in a left and right roll so a go-around was executed.,2015,08
79,201508,INDIANA,WE WERE FLYING TRAINING SORTIE FOR A PHOTO RECONNAISSANCE MISSION FLYING LEVEL AT 2;500 FEET MSL WHEN A FLUORESCENCE ORANGE SMALL DRONE APPEARED TO THE LEFT OF THE WIND SCREEN FOR APPROXIMATELY 2 SECONDS BEFORE PASSING JUST OVER THE LEFT WING OF THE AIRCRAFT. APPROACH ADVISED AND PILOT PROVIDED TELEPHONE NUMBER TO ATC FOR ADDITIONAL INFO ONCE ON THE GROUND. THE BREVITY OF THE ENCOUNTER DID NOT ALLOW FOR EVASIVE ACTION.,C172 pilot experiences a NMAC with a drone at 2;500 feet.,2015,08
80,201508,MASSACHUSETTS,WHILE APPROACHING AND PREPARING TO ENTER THE TRAFFIC PATTERN AT PYM AND ABOUT FOUR OR FIVE MILES FROM THE FIELD; WE ENCOUNTERED NUMEROUS (ESTIMATED ABOUT FIFTY) HELIUM FILLED BALLOONS LAUNCHED FROM THE GROUND. WE WERE AT ABOUT 1200 FEET MSL; AND HAD LITTLE OR NO TIME FOR EVASIVE ACTION. I BELIEVE THAT THESE BALLOONS WERE LAUNCHED FROM THE GROUND TO CELEBRATE THE BEGINNING OF THE [A] BICYCLE RACE. FORTUNATELY; NO BALLOONS STRUCK THE AIRCRAFT. WE REPORTED THE INCIDENT ON THE UNICOM FREQUENCY TO WARN OTHER AIRCRAFT. THERE WAS NO NOTAM FOR THE EVENT THAT TOOK PLACE IN THE VICINITY OF THE AIRPORT (LAKEVILLE; MA). SUGGEST THESE TYPES OF EVENTS DESERVE EITHER A NOTAM OR SHOULD BE PROHIBITED AT DISTANCE CLOSE TO AN AIRPORT.,AA5B pilot reported encountering a large number of balloons in flight that had been released in the vicinity of his destination; PYM.,2015,08
81,201508,MASSACHUSETTS,AT 800 FEET OVER BOSTON HARBOR WHILE ON A VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 04R AT BOS; WHAT AT FIRST GLANCE SEEMED TO BE A LARGE WHITE BIRD CAUGHT MY ATTENTION AT OUR 3-3:30 POSITION; SOME 200 FEET-400 FEET BELOW OUR ALTITUDE; AND AN ESTIMATED 100-200 YARDS TO OUR RIGHT. I'M SURE I WOULDN'T HAVE NOTICED THE 'BIRD' OVER LAND; BUT IT STOOD OUT AGAINST THE DEEP BLUE-GREEN OF THE HARBOR. AND ITS WINGS WEREN'T FLAPPING. OOPS. I THEN QUICKLY RECOGNIZED THE FAMILIAR SHAPE OF A TOY; IT WAS A DJI PHANTOM DRONE. BECAUSE IT WAS WELL BENEATH US; NO AVOIDANCE MANEUVERING WAS NECESSARY; BUT I CALLED OUT ITS POSITION TO THE CAPTAIN PILOT FLYING (PF) AND THEN TO BOS TOWER; WHO QUICKLY RELAYED THE ALERT TO TRAFFIC FOLLOWING US ON THE APPROACH; AND WHO; AFTER WE LANDED; ASKED ME TO PHONE THE TOWER SUPERVISOR WITH DETAILS; WHICH I DID. ALTHOUGH NO MANEUVERING WAS NECESSARY; THE SIGHTING AND RELAYING OF THE DRONE'S LOCATION CLEARLY DISTRACTED FROM MY OTHER DUTIES DURING ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL PHASES OF FLIGHT. I'VE SPOKEN WITH SEVERAL OTHER PILOTS WHO KNOW FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS WITH DRONES; OR WHO HAVE PURCHASED ONE FOR THEMSELVES OR THEIR CHILDREN. I WOULD HOPE THEY ALL REALIZE THAT THE VERY DENSE AND HEAVY NATURE OF THE BATTERIES ON THESE MACHINES ARE GOING TO CAUSE FAR GREATER DAMAGE THAN A BIRD OF EQUIVALENT WEIGHT; WHEN ONE FINALLY; AND IT SEEMS INEVITABLY; IMPACTS A WINDSCREEN; JET ENGINE; OR FLAP ASSEMBLY. IT'S GOING TO BE UGLY; AND WE REALLY NEED TO SPREAD THE WORD. SO I WOULD URGE ANYONE READING THIS WHO OPERATE DRONES; TO ASK THEM TO VISIT HTTP://KNOWBEFOREYOUFLY.ORG AND MAKE SURE THEY FULLY UNDERSTAND WHERE AND WHEN DRONES ARE APPROPRIATE. BECAUSE OF ITS ALTITUDE; I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF THE ONE WE SAW HAD BEEN LAUNCHED IN COMPLETE INNOCENCE OFF A BOAT IN THE HARBOR; SIMPLY TO TAKE PHOTOS OR VIDEOS OF THE BOAT'S OWNERS.IT MAY TO BE ONE OF THE MOST HARMLESS DRONE/AIRCRAFT ENCOUNTERS ON RECORD; YET IT WAS STILL; IF FOR NO OTHER REASON THAN THE DISTRACTION; A HAZARD TO AIR NAVIGATION.,B737 First Officer reports a drone at 800 feet AGL during approach to Runway 4R at BOS. The drone was 200 to 400 feet below and to the right of the B737 and no evasive action was necessary.,2015,08
82,201508,MICHIGAN,WE OPERATED INTO DTW AND HAD A LITTLE OVER AN HOUR SIT BEFORE OUR FLIGHT OUT. AFTER WE SHUT DOWN; THE FO GOT OUT TO DO HIS WALK AROUND; WHILE I ESCORTED AN UNACCOMPANIED MINOR TO THE TOP OF THE JETWAY. AFTER THAT I WENT AND GRABBED A CHEESEBURGER. WHEN I GOT BACK TO THE PLANE; THE ONLY PEOPLE ON BOARD WERE THE FA AND A CHECK AIRMAN WHO WAS ABOUT TO DO MY LINE CHECK. BOTH WERE SEATED IN THE BACK OF THE AIRCRAFT. I WENT AND SAT IN THE MAIN CABIN AS WELL.  AFTER A FEW MINUTES; AN UNIDENTIFIED INDIVIDUAL CAME ON BOARD AND SAID WE HAD AN ENGINE RUNNING. WHEN I CHECKED; THE NUMBER TWO ENGINE WAS RUNNING NEAR IDLE. I SHUT IT DOWN IMMEDIATELY.,Air carrier Captain reported leaving the cockpit after parking the aircraft and realizing later one engine was left running.,2015,08
83,201508,MINNESOTA,I WAS A PILOT ON THE GROUND IN BATTLE CREEK PARK APPROXIMATELY 1 MILE EAST OF STP. I NOTICED A DRONE HOVERING ON THE BASE LEG VFR APPROACH TO RUNWAYS 13 AND 14 DUE NORTH OF MY POSITION AND AT THE SAME ALTITUDE THAT A R44 HELICOPTER WAS OPERATING THAT DAY. THIS IS NOT A GOOD PLACE TO BE OPERATING A DRONE. I'VE FLOWN THIS APPROACH TO STP IN THE PAST IN A HELICOPTER; AND I DON'T WANT TO HIT A DRONE COMING INTO LAND AT STP. THE R44 HELICOPTER I SAW WAS LOWER THAN THE DRONE WAS TODAY.,Private pilot observing from the ground; reports a NMAC between an R44 helicopter and a drone during a visual approach to Runway 13 or 14 at STP. The drone was hovering near the base leg of the VFR traffic pattern and 100 feet above the helicopter.,2015,08
84,201508,MINNESOTA,DEPARTING RUNWAY 14 FROM ST. PAUL (KSTP) WE HAD A BIRD STRIKE DURING THE TAKEOFF ROLL. AFTER BEING CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF; WE TOOK THE RUNWAY AND COMMENCED THE TAKEOFF ROLL. AT 60 KNOTS THE PM (PILOT MONITORING) CALLED 'POWER SET'; FOLLOWED THEN BY THE CALL '80 KNOTS'. AT THAT MOMENT I NOTICED A BALD EAGLE COMING AT US FROM THE RIGHT; ONLY A FEW METERS FROM THE NOSE. I STATED 'BIRD' AND ATTEMPTED TO STEER THE AIRCRAFT SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT. THE EAGLE CONTINUED TOWARD OUR AIRCRAFT AND FLEW UNDER THE NOSE. AT APPROXIMATELY 90 KNOTS THE PM CALLED 'ABORT' AT THE SAME TIME I HAD PULLED THE THROTTLES BACK TO IDLE AND DEPLOYED THE THRUST REVERSERS. THE PM THEN DEPLOYED THE SPEED BRAKES AS A BACKUP TO THE ABORT PROCEDURES. THE AIRCRAFT WAS BROUGHT TO A SLOW SPEED AND WE CLEARED THE RUNWAY AT TAXIWAY A2. DURING POST FLIGHT IT WAS DISCOVERED THAT THE EAGLE HAD STRUCK OUR NOSE GEAR; THEN THE LEFT LEADING EDGE WING ROOT FOLLOWED BY THE LOWER LEFT ENGINE COWL. [MAINTENANCE CONTROL] WAS ADVISED AND IMMEDIATELY CLEARED THE BIRD REMAINS FROM RUNWAY 14; AND WE MET WITH THE USDA BACK IN OUR HANGAR BEFORE DEPARTING WITH ANOTHER AIRCRAFT TO COMPLETE THE MISSION.,A flight crew reported that their aircraft was struck by an eagle during the takeoff roll. The takeoff was successfully rejected and the aircraft returned to the hangar for damage assessment.,2015,08
85,201508,MINNESOTA,AIRCRAFT Y WAS IN A MOA 500B590.  AIRCRAFT X WAS IN A BLOCK 490B510 AND FLEW INTO THE AIRSPACE THAT AIRCRAFT Y WAS IN.  I THOUGHT YOU HAD TO MISS THE AIRPLANE BUT APPARENTLY YOU HAVE TO MISS THE WHOLE AIRSPACE; WHICH CAN BE THE WHOLE STATE OF ND.  AIRCRAFT Y AND AIRCRAFT X WERE 141 MILES APART.  I THINK THIS IS RIDICULOUS. MISS JUST THE AIRPLANE.,A ZMP Controller reports of a loss of separation because a UAV was in a MOA and another aircraft was in the same MOA. The aircraft he was in control of was inside of the MOA and should not have been.,2015,08
86,201508,MINNESOTA,SEVERAL HELICOPTERS WERE CIRCLING OVER THE MINNESOTA STATE FAIRGROUNDS COVERING A PROTEST WHEN A MULTI-ROTOR DRONE COPTER WAS SEEN OVER THE INTERSECTION OF COMO AVENUE AND SNELLING AVENUE. IT APPEARED THAT ONE [HELICOPTER] PILOT MANEUVERED AWAY FROM THE DRONE AS HE CAME TOWARD THE INTERSECTION FROM THE NORTH. THE DRONE WAS OPERATED OVER PEOPLE GOING TO THE FAIR. THE FAA NEEDS TO EMPHASIZE THE EXTREME DANGER OF HAVING A LOST LINK NEAR A MANNED HELICOPTER OVER A LARGE CROWD OF PEOPLE. THIS HAZARD HAS NOT BEEN REDUCED TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF RISK THROUGH CERTIFICATION. FURTHERMORE; IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE NEARBY HELICOPTERS IN TIME TO SEE AND AVOID IN URBAN AREAS LIKE WHERE THE AMATEUR PILOT WAS WORKING. SUCH A COLLISION WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC (RESULTING IN MULTIPLE FATALITIES).,An observer; pilot qualified; reported a UAS at about 400 feet in conflict with several helicopters circling near the Minnesota State Fairgrounds.,2015,08
87,201508,MONTANA,AFTER BEING CLEARED DIRECT TO AVDIH THE RNAV (GPS) Z RUNWAY 2 IF AT GPI BY SALT LAKE CENTER WE WERE CLEARED FROM 10;000 MSL TO MAINTAIN 9;000 MSL UNTIL AVDIH; REPORT ESTABLISHED; CLEARED RNAV (GPS) Z RUNWAY 2 APPROACH. WE OPTED TO USE THE IF VS MAKING A 180 DEGREE COURSE REVERSAL OVER THE IAF KILLY DUE TO HIGHER TERRAIN OVER KILLY AND THE COMPLEXITY OF THE COURSE REVERSAL. WE DID NOT ANTICIPATE THE 9;000 MSL ALTITUDE ASSIGNMENT OVER AVDIH (PUBLISHED AT 7;000 MSL); HOWEVER; WE HAD AMPLE TIME/DISTANCE TO SAFELY GET TO THE LPV GLIDE PATH ALTITUDE OF 5;200 MSL OVER BINGQ THE FAF.THE PILOT FLYING (PF) ACKNOWLEDGED 9;000 WAS SET IN THE ALTITUDE PRE-SELECTOR. I; AS PILOT MONITORING (PM); WENT HEADS DOWN TO INSURE THE FMS WAS PROPERLY PROGRAMED FOR THE STRAIGHT IN APPROACH BOTH LATERALLY AND VERTICALLY. WE WERE IN HEADING MODE WITH LNAV ARMED; ALTITUDE CAPTURED AT 10;000 WITH THE AUTOPILOT ON. PF DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPILOT WHILE I WAS HEADS DOWN AND UNINTENTIONALLY BALLOONED TO 10;400. I CALLED OUT THE ALTITUDE DEVIATION AND COMMANDED HIM TO DESCEND TO 9;000 WHILE NUDGING THE YOKE FORWARD TO PREVENT FURTHER ALTITUDE GAIN. WE HAD TO SLOW DOWN AND MAKE CONFIGURATION CHANGES (FLAP/LANDING GEAR) DURING THE DESCENT TO 9;000. WHILE STILL HAND FLYING; THE PF FAILED TO MAINTAIN 9;000 UNTIL AVDIH BUT DESCENDED TO 8;800 INITIALLY. AGAIN; I CALLED OUT THE DEVIATION AND COMMANDED HIM TO MAINTAIN 9;000. WE INTERCEPTED THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE OUTSIDE OF AVDIH AND LNAV LATER GUIDANCE WAS CAPTURED/USED.AFTER CROSSING AVDIH; WE THEN DESCENDED TO INTERCEPT THE VGP AND CROSSED THE FAF AT THE APPROPRIATE ALTITUDE. THE REST OF THE APPROACH CONTINUED NORMALLY.THERE WERE NO TERRAIN OR TRAFFIC CONFLICTS.CONTRIBUTING FACTORS: PF WAS USING THE SYNTHETIC VISION SYSTEM DISPLAY. ALTHOUGH HE HAD COMPLETED SIMULATOR TRAINING WITH THE EQUIPMENT WITHIN THE PREVIOUS 6 MONTHS; HE DID NOT HAVE A LOT OF ACTUAL EXPERIENCE USING THE EQUIPMENT IN THE PLANE. WE DID NOT ANTICIPATE BEING 2;000 FEET ABOVE THE IF ALTITUDE WHEN WE WERE CLEARED FOR THE APPROACH. THE ARRIVAL DIRECTION WOULD HAVE MADE THE IAF TO IF COURSE REVERSAL DIFFICULT; BUT WOULD HAVE GIVEN US MORE TIME TO DESCEND TO THE IF ALTITUDE. PF DID NOT HAVE THE CORRECT VERTICAL SITUATIONAL AWARENESS FOR THE ATC CLEARANCE ISSUED. PF ADMITTED TO BEING CONFUSED/DISTRACTED BY THE CONFORMAL NATURE OF THE SVS DISPLAY LEADING TO FURTHER LOSS OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. PM WENT HEADS DOWN BEFORE INSURING THE DESCENT FROM 10;000 TO 9;000 WAS PROPERLY INITIATED BY THE PF.HUMAN PERFORMANCE FACTORS: THE CREW WAS WELL RESTED AND FLYING DURING NORMAL DAYLIGHT WAKEFUL HOURS. BOTH PILOTS HAVE BEEN WITH THE COMPANY LESS THAN 1 YEAR. PF HAS LITTLE FLYING EXPERIENCE OUTSIDE OF USAF OPERATIONS AND IS STILL ADJUSTING TO CIVILIAN OPERATIONS/PROCEDURES. TASK SATURATION DIMINISHED SITUATIONAL AWARENESS FOR BOTH PF AND PM.THE EVENT IS BEING REVIEWED WITHIN OUR [COMPANY SAFETY DEPARTMENT]. PROCEDURES WILL BE REVIEWED AND CORRECTIVE ACTIONS WILL BE TAKEN TO INCREASE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND DECREASE WORKLOAD DURING APPROACHES.,A GLF5 First Officer (FO) reported the Captain experienced several altitude deviations on approach that the FO felt were caused at least in part by the use of a synthetic vision system.,2015,08
88,201508,NEW MEXICO,DRONE WAS 2 FEET IN DIAMETER AT EXACTLY 5000 MSL ON PXR 030 AT 23 DME; EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN. IT WAS SILVER AND CYLINDRICAL.,An instructor reported a close encounter with a drone (UAV) at an altitude of 5;000 feet; requiring an evasive maneuver.,2015,08
89,201508,NEW YORK,ON APPROACH TO 31R INTO JFK WE HAD A NEAR MISS WITH A SILVER OR WHITE COLORED DRONE. IT PASSED APPROXIMATELY 100 FT OR LESS OFF THE LEFT WING AT OUR ALTITUDE ON APPROACH. IT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET SQUARE IN SIZE. I ONLY SAW IT MOMENTARILY AS WE FLEW PAST IT. THE CAPTAIN DID NOT SEE IT.,An air carrier First Officer on a JFK Runway 31R Visual Approach at 1;500 feet reported a 100 foot near miss with an UAV; approximately three square feet. The Captain; pilot flying; did not see the object.,2015,08
90,201508,NEW YORK,3 MILES SOUTH OF ASALT INTERSECTION ON THE RNAV VISUAL 13L AT 3000 FT BOTH PILOTS OBSERVED A SMALL DRONE THE SIZE OF A STREET GARBAGE CAN COVER WITH FOUR VERTICAL ENGINES PASSES APPROXIMATELY 300 FT DIRECTLY BELOW OUR AIRCRAFT. WE WERE ON A NORTH HEADING AND DRONE APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING SOUTH. HOWEVER WITH OUR SPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 220 KTS IT MAY HAVE BEEN TRAVELING IN OUR DIRECTION WITH US OVERTAKING IT. THE COLOR OF THE DRONE WAS METALLIC IN APPREHENDED WITH ORANGE COLORS NEAR ITS FOUR ENGINES. POSSIBLY THE PROPELLERS WERE ORANGE? NO EVASIVE ACTION REQUIRED. ATC NOTIFIED AROUND 10 SECONDS AFTER BOTH PILOTS CONFIRMED OUR SIGHTING. UPON LANDING JFK TOWER GAVE ME A PHONE NUMBER WITH RADAR TO FOLLOW UP ON THE VERBAL REPORT.,A321 flight crew reported a near miss with a UAV at 3;000 FT while on visual approach Runway 31L at JFK near the ASALT intersection.,2015,08
91,201508,NEW YORK,CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH UAV SUNDAY 5 MILES NORTHEAST OF WINDHAM HIGH PEAK IN GREENE COUNTY NEW YORK AT ABOUT 3;500 FEET ALTITUDE.I WAS PILOTING AND HAD A PASSENGER ALONG FOR HIS FIRST FLIGHT. WE COULD NOT SEE ANY KIND OF WINGS; ROTORS; OR FORM OF PROPULSION. UNFORTUNATELY MY CAMERA WAS STUCK IN MY POCKET UNDER TIGHT SEAT BELTS AND I COULDN'T GET IT OUT WHILE FLYING THE GLIDER TRYING TO AVOID HITTING THIS THING.IT WAS ABOUT 6 FEET TALL; 2-3 FEET WIDE. TOP OF UAV WAS EXTREMELY RADIANT; WITH BLACK HALF SPHERE UNDER THE RADIANT TOP AND WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN ANTENNA UNDER THE HALF SPHERE; WE WATCHED IT SKIMMING OVER THE TREE TOPS BELOW AND TO THE RIGHT OF OUR FLIGHT PATH. IT WAS MOVING AT A FAST SPEED SOUTHWEST TOWARD WINDHAM HIGH PEAK. IT HAD A VERY SPARKLING APPEARANCE LIKE SUN SHINING ON A MIRROR WITH RAINBOW COLORS. I WAS FLYING NORTHEAST FROM WINDHAM HIGH PEAK AT ABOUT 3500 FEET. AS WE WATCHED THE UAV I BANKED TO THE LEFT AND HALF WAY THROUGH THE TURN AND NOW POINTING AT WINDHAM HIGH PEAK; THE UAV TURNED AROUND AND CAME TOWARD US AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. AS I GOT 3/4 OF THE WAY THROUGH THE TURN WAS WITHIN 50 YARDS OF MY RIGHT WING; QUICKLY GOT IN FRONT OF ME AND FOLLOWED ME AROUND THE TURN GETTING CLOSER UNTIL IT WAS OFF MY LEFT WING; PROBABLY NO MORE THAN 25-30 YARDS AWAY. IT COVERED ABOUT 5 MILES IN JUST A FEW SECONDS. WE HAD A REALLY GOOD VIEW OF IT.AS IT GOT OFF MY LEFT WING; MY PASSENGER LOOKED UP AND SAW TWO MORE UAVS COME OUT OF THE CLOUD DIRECTLY OVER US. AT THAT POINT I TOLD MY PASSENGER WE WERE RETURNING IMMEDIATELY TO THE AIRPORT; I PUSHED THE NOSE DOWN AND PICKED UP SPEED. THE UAVS THEN HEADED TO THE WEST AT A FAST SPEED.,A pilot flying near Windham High Peak in Greene County New York; at 3;500 feet was approached by an elaborate UAV with a brilliant surface on top of an inverted bowl shaped container with long rectangular antennas protruding downward. The UAV approached; tracked; and flew around the reporter before speeding off toward the west with two other like shaped UAVs.,2015,08
92,201508,NEW YORK,SIGHTED A DRONE WHILE APPROACHING TO LAND RWY 22 AT LGA.  IT WAS SEEN WITHIN A 2 MILE FINAL SLIGHTLY BELOW AND TO THE LEFT OF OUR AIRCRAFT AT A DISTANCE OF LESS THAN 100 YARDS.  IT WAS REPORTED TO THE TOWER WITH A FOLLOW UP PHONE CALL TO THE SUPERVISOR AS REQUESTED BY THE CONTROLLER IN POSITION.,PC-12 Captain reports sighting a drone on final approach to Runway 22 at LGA. No evasive action is necessary.,2015,08
93,201508,PENNSYLVANIA,WHILE BEING VECTORED TO AIRPORT 9G1; I (AS PILOT NOT FLYING) WAS MONITORING AND COMMUNICATING ON THE CTAF FREQUENCY FOR THE DESTINATION AIRPORT. I WAS UNABLE TO CONTACT THE FBO PERSONNEL; BUT DID CONTACT A HELICOPTER; WHO WAS PARKED ON THE APPROACH END OF RUNWAY 35 WAITING TO DEPART. APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES EAST OF 9G1; THE PIC ELECTED TO CANCEL THE IFR PORTION OF THE FLIGHT AND CONTINUE VFR. THE PIC HAD BRIEFED A VISUAL APPROACH; BACKED UP ELECTRONICALLY WITH AN OMNI BEARING SELECTOR (OBS); AND LANDING ON RUNWAY 35 BASED ON THE CALM WINDS AND THE POSITION OF THE DROP-OFF LOCATION FOR THE PASSENGER ON-BOARD.APPROXIMATELY FIVE (5) MILES EAST OF THE AIRPORT; I CALLED ON CTAF TO RELAY OUR INTENTIONS TO THE HELICOPTER AND CONFIRM HIS POSITION AND INTENTIONS. THE HELICOPTER SAID THAT HE WAS WAITING FOR AN IFR RELEASE. I RESPONDED THAT WE JUST CANCELLED WITH PITTSBURG APPROACH AND THAT HE SHOULD HAVE HIS CLEARANCE. AT THIS TIME; THE PIC NOTED THE RISING TERRAIN WEST OF THE AIRPORT AND THAT HE WAS GOING TO FLY A RIGHT TRAFFIC PATTERN FOR RUNWAY 35 INSTEAD OF OVER-FLYING THE AIRPORT AND ENTER LEFT-TRAFFIC; AS PREVIOUSLY BRIEF. THE HELICOPTER SAID THAT HE WAS MOVING OFF THE RUNWAY TO THE GRASS AREA EAST OF THE RUNWAY SO THAT WE MAY LAND RUNWAY 35.AS WE TURNED SOUTH FOR THE RIGHT DOWNWIND LEG; I COULD SEE THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS MOVING OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE RUNWAY. ONCE TURNING FINAL; THE PIC (PILOT-FLYING) NOTED THAT THE HELICOPTER WAS CLEAR OF THE RUNWAY AND WAS CONTINUING TO LAND RUNWAY 35. I MADE ALL APPROPRIATE DOWNWIND; BASE; AND FINAL CALLS ON CTAF AND THE HELICOPTER CALLED THAT HE WAS CLEAR OF THE RUNWAY. WE LANDED ON RUNWAY 35 WITH A SAFE DISTANCE BETWEEN US (AIRCRAFT LANDING) AND HELICOPTER (PARKED IN GRASS.)THE ISSUE WAS WITH A WOMAN (WHO NEVER IDENTIFIED HERSELF) WHO BELIEVED THAT OUR LANDING CREATED A SAFETY PROBLEM. SHE QUESTIONED ME IF I CONTACTED THE AIRPORT PRIOR TO LANDING. I TOLD HER THAT I DID TRY ON THE CTAF FREQUENCY BUT NO ONE ANSWERED; BUT THE HELICOPTER DID; AND THAT WE WERE IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH THE HELICOPTER. SHE DID NOT ACCEPT THIS; EVEN WHEN ANOTHER WOMAN (POSSIBLY HER ASSISTANT) [SAID] THAT SHE DID NOT HAVE THE RADIO.PUTTING MYSELF AS AN OBSERVER ON THE GROUND; I COULD SEE HOW AN AIRCRAFT LANDING AND A HELICOPTER MIGHT SEEM CLOSE; BASED ON THE STRAIGHT LINE VIEW THAT THEY HAD; AND A DISTORTED VIEW OF PERSPECTIVE BASED ON RELATIVE SIZE AND THE DISTANCE. BUT THE AIRCRAFT; AND HELICOPTER WERE IN CONSTANT CONTACT; BOTH FOUND THE LANDING SITUATION/ DISTANCE ACCEPTABLE.UNIDENTIFIED OBSERVERS ON THE GROUND; WITHOUT RADIOS TO LISTEN TO THE AIRCRAFT COORDINATION SHOULD NOT MAKE SAFETY DECISIONS AFTER-THE-FACT.,A flight crew was in communication with a helicopter that was working in the pattern at the airport where the crew was to land. The helicopter pilot was parked in a grass area next to the runway waiting IFR release. The plane landed. An unidentified woman took exception to the distance between the plane and the helicopter and would not accept explanations.,2015,08
94,201509,CALIFORNIA,CRUISE AT 6;500 LEVEL; 270 HEADING; ABEAM 99CL (ADELANTO); PCAS FLASHING TRAFFIC DEAD AHEAD SAME ALTITUDE INBOUND CLOSING FAST! MADE CONTACT OF DRONE DIRECTLY IN MY WINDSCREEN; HARD RIGHT BANK WITH FORWARD PUSH OF YOKE TO AVOID THIS TRAFFIC. CONTACTED JOSHUA APPROACH IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS; CONTROLLER SAID HE ISSUED A CONFLICT WARNING BUT DID NOT AT THAT TIME HAVE CONTROL OF THE DRONE.  I BELIEVE THAT IF I HAD NOT CONDUCTED AN EVASIVE MANEUVER; I WOULD NOT BE WRITING THIS REPORT. APPROXIMATELY 9 MONTHS AGO IN THIS SAME AREA; I WAS RETURNING HOME; 11;500 FEET CRUISE; AND I NOTICED A DRONE IN THE EDWARDS AIRSPACE PARALLEL WITH MY FLIGHT. THE DRONE ASCENDED TO MY ALTITUDE AND TURNED DIRECTLY TO ME ON A COLLISION COURSE; CROSSED DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF ME CAUSING ANOTHER EVASIVE ENCOUNTER ON MY PART.  THEN AS TO HIDE THE FACT MY PCAS UNIT QUIT REPORTING THE CONFLICT AS IF THE DRONE TURNED OFF IT'S TRANSPONDER. WHO IS FLYING THESE DRONES? I'M SCARED.,Pilot took evasive action to avoid a drone near 99CL.,2015,09
95,201509,CALIFORNIA,UPON ARRIVAL AT GATE; A PASSENGER CAME TO THE COCKPIT AND REPORTED SEEING AN AERIAL DRONE NEAR THE LEFT WING OF AIRCRAFT ON SHORT FINAL TO RUNWAY 7R. NEITHER THE PILOT FLYING NOR I SAW ANYTHING ON SHORT FINAL. A PHONE CALL WAS MADE TO LAX TOWER TO REPORT THE ALLEGED SIGHTING.,A B737 Passenger reported seeing a UAS on short final to LAX Runway 7R. The Pilots did not see the object.,2015,09
96,201509,CALIFORNIA,I WAS WORKING ANTELOPE SECTOR WITHOUT ASSISTANCE; WHICH CAN BE VERY CHALLENGING; THIS WAS ONE OF THOSE CHALLENGING DAYS.  THIS PARTICULAR DAY; WE WERE DEALING WITH A SHORT-STAFFING SITUATION THAT DIDN'T PROVIDE FOR MUCH OPPORTUNITY OF A HANDOFF TO ASSIST ME.  I WAS DEALING WITH AN LOA MATTER; OF DESCENDING AIRCRAFT OUT OF ZLA AIRSPACE REFERENCE AIRCRAFT Y ORBITING AT VFR/125 BLOCKING DESCENT FROM 140 TO EVEN AN UNDESIRABLE DESCENT TO 130.  SO; I HAD BEEN STEPPING DOWN AN AIRCRAFT Z AND AIRCRAFT A WITH COMM ISSUES THAT HAD ME CONSTANTLY SWITCHING FROM EDW TO A BACKUP SITE (PEARBLOSSOM) DUE TO LIMITED COVERAGE AND MUFFLED READ BACKS. UNCERTAIN WHAT THE ISSUES WERE; I ALSO WAS TRYING TO SWITCH FROM FOOT PEDAL TO HANDSET TO DETERMINE THE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM WHICH REQUIRED ME TO MAKE NUMEROUS DUPLICATE CALLS TO THE SAME AIRCRAFT TO ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.  APPARENTLY I GAVE A VFR AIRCRAFT; THE ONE IN QUESTION; AIRCRAFT X; AN IFR CLEARANCE EXITING A MOA TOO SOON; PERHAPS THERE WAS ONLY 2-1/2 MILES INSTEAD OF 3 AT THE TIME I ISSUED THE IFR CLEARANCE.  ADDING TO THE PRESSURE OF THE SITUATION WAS A FRONT LINE MANAGER (FLM) SITTING BESIDE ME; WHO DIDN'T INFORM ME OF THE INCIDENT UNTIL AN HOUR LATER; WHEN I RECEIVED MY 1ST BREAK FOR THE DAY.  AT THE END OF THE DAY; I DISCUSSED THE MATTER WITH OUR AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT AS I WAS WALKING OUT THE DOOR; HAVING REVIEWED THE INCIDENT WITH OUR RADAR REVIEW PROGRAM. THERE ARE NUMEROUS SUGGESTIONS THAT COULD BE MADE; BUT MOSTLY I WOULD SAY IN MY LIMITED HOURS PER MONTH; I NEEDED MORE PATIENCE AT TIMES BUT I ALSO FEEL I WAS STRUGGLING WITH PRIORITIES: GOOD; BETTER; BEST.  IT'S ON ME; IN OTHER WORDS.  BEYOND THAT; I NEEDED ASSISTANCE WITH LANDLINE COORDINATION; MAKING CALLS OR RECEIVING THEM.  THERE SEEMED TO BE INABILITIES FOR SUCH MATTERS TO BE HANDLED QUICKLY; OR EASILY; IN NUMEROUS INSTANCES. AIRCRAFT Z WAS GIVEN A CROSSING RESTRICTION FROM 130 WHILE EAST OF PMD [REFERENCE] VFR/115 TRAFFIC JUST CLEARING WITH AMPLE TIME TO CROSS JANNY AT AND MAINTAIN 080 BUT REPORTED LATER UNABLE TO MAKE IT (PILOT DEVIATION?).  AS I CALLED ZLA-04; WITH A POINT OUT THEY ACCEPTED; THE FLM ATTEMPTED TO CALL SCT-VLY BUT THEY WERE UNRESPONSIVE.  ONCE TOLD OF THAT SITUATION; I CALLED THEM BACK WITH A MORE FORCEFUL TONE OF VOICE WHICH ACCOMPLISHED THE GOAL: 'POINT OUT APPROVED.'  LATER IN THE DAY; IN AN UNRELATED MATTER; [REFERENCE ANOTHER AIRCRAFT] I GAVE 'LOST COMM' FOR SCT-POMONA AND ACCOMPLISHED A POINT OUT WITH SCT-GLENDALE THAT THEY SEEMED RELUCTANT TO ACCEPT; BOTHERED AS IF I HAD CALLED THE WRONG SECTOR (EXPECTING ME TO CALL SCT-VALLEY PERHAPS?) I CHECKED OUR APPROACH AIRSPACE MAP TO VALIDATE I HAD CALLED THE APPROPRIATE SECTOR WITH THAT POINT OUT. SO; AGAIN; FREQUENCY COVERAGE WASN'T THE BEST; WHICH THE FLM CONFIRMED HAD ALSO BEEN A PROBLEM THE PRIOR DAY; AND LANDLINE COORDINATION WASN'T MUCH BETTER.  WE ALSO DISCUSSED LOA MATTERS OF DESCENDING AIRCRAFT Z AND AIRCRAFT A PER LOA WITH ZLA; WHICH HONESTLY COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ACCOMPLISHED ANY BETTER WITHOUT NUMEROUS TCAS RAS UNLESS I HAD A HANDOFF ASSISTING WITH REQUESTS FOR 'CONTROL' OF WHATEVER TYPE WAS REQUIRED IN THAT MOMENT THROUGHOUT THE 4 PLUS 10 HOURS I WORKED THAT SECTOR TODAY.,A JCF controller reports of bad radios along with an orbiting UAV that was in the way of descending aircraft. The Controller reports of a loss of separation between IFR aircraft a VFR aircraft leaving a MOA. The Controller reported of other issues that may have led to his lack of awareness and not feeling competent about his work that day.,2015,09
97,201509,FLORIDA,DEPARTING TPA RUNWAY 01L. POSSIBLE DRONE SIGHTING 200 FEET IN ALTITUDE OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF RUNWAY ABOUT ON-FOURTH TO ONE-HALF LEFT OF CENTERLINE. REPORTED TO ATC. FLIGHT CONTINUED NORMALLY.,After takeoff an Air Carrier Captain reported a possible UAS at 200 feet; approximately one third of a mile to the left of TPA Runway 1L centerline.,2015,09
98,201509,HAWAII,WE WERE ON THE TAKEOFF ROLL FROM RUNWAY 04 AT PHMU. AT OR JUST BEFORE ROTATION SPEED OF 70 KNOTS; I SAW SOMETHING SMALL AND BLACK GO STRAIGHT OVER THE AIRCRAFT.  I THOUGHT WE HAD JUST BARELY MISSED WHATEVER IT WAS. THE CAPTAIN I WAS FLYING WITH SAID IT WAS A BIRD AND IT HAD GONE THROUGH THE PROPELLER. I DIDN'T SEE IT GO THROUGH THE PROPELLER; AND NEITHER OF US FELT A 'THUD' OR ANY SORT OF IMPACT FROM THE BIRD.  ALL OF OUR ENGINE INSTRUMENTS WERE READING NORMAL; THERE WERE NO UNUSUAL VIBRATIONS FROM THE PROPELLER; AND NONE OF OUR AVIONICS OR RADIOS HAD GONE OFFLINE. ALTHOUGH WE WERE NO MORE THAN A COUPLE MILES FROM THE AIRPORT AND A THOUSAND FEET OR SO IN ALTITUDE; WE ELECTED TO CONTINUE TO OUR DESTINATION.THE FLIGHT CONTINUED UNEVENTFULLY. UPON ARRIVAL; WE DISCOVERED SOME RESIDUE FROM THE BIRD THAT WE HAD HIT ON A FOUR INCH SECTION OF ONE OF THE PROPELLER BLADES.  THAT WAS THE ONLY EVIDENCE THAT WE HAD OF A BIRD STRIKE; AND THE PLANE TOOK NO DAMAGE ELSEWHERE. THE PROPELLER BLADE SUFFERED NOTHING MORE THAN A FEW SMEARS; AND MAINTENANCE QUICKLY INSPECTED AND RETURNED THE AIRCRAFT TO SERVICE.IN HINDSIGHT; OUR DECISION TO CONTINUE WAS UNSAFE. WE HAD NO IDEA IF OR HOW MUCH DAMAGE THE AIRCRAFT HAD TAKEN; IF IT HAD TAKEN ANY AT ALL. WE WERE CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT AND COULD HAVE EASILY RETURNED FOR LANDING. THERE IS NO MAINTENANCE BASE; THOUGH; BUT THAT IS NO EXCUSE TO [NOT] LAND THERE. AND SINCE WE WERE JUST ROTATING AS THE BIRD STRUCK; I COULD HAVE CALLED TO ABORT THE TAKEOFF; AS WE HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH RUNWAY AVAILABLE TO STOP THE AIRCRAFT. BOTH OF OUR DECISION MAKING WAS HINDERED THAT DAY; AS WE WERE BOTH TIRED AND HAD ALREADY STARTED THE FLIGHT CATCHING ERRORS.,An air taxi aircraft struck a bird on the takeoff roll from PHMU and continued to their destination where Maintenance found bird strike evidence on one of the propeller blades.,2015,09
99,201509,INDIANA,I WAS ON AN IFR FLIGHT PLAN TO UMP AND IN CONTACT WITH ATC AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT. DESCENDING THROUGH 3;200 MSL; HEADING 180 DEGREES AND AROUND 4 MILES NE FROM UMP; A DISC SHAPED OBJECT APPROX. 16 INCHES TO 2 FEET ACROSS PASSED WITHIN 100 FEET OF MY RIGHT WING TIP AND WAS AT OR VERY CLOSE TO MY ALTITUDE.  THE OBJECT PASSED VERY QUICKLY; BUT I HAD TIME TO POINT IT OUT TO MY WIFE (ACTING AS CO-PILOT AT THE TIME. SHE HOLDS A PRIVATE PILOT CERTIFICATE AND IS IFR RATED AND CURRENT. APPROX. 1;000 HOURS AS PILOT IN COMMAND). IT WAS THE OPINION OF BOTH OF US THAT THE OBJECT MUST BE A DRONE AND NOT A BALLOON OR KITE. I ADVISED ATC OF THE INCIDENT.,A pilot reported a near miss with a UAS while descending through 3;200 feet on an IFR flight to UMP.,2015,09
100,201509,PENNSYLVANIA,PROBLEM: SUPPOSED 'SETTLEMENT POND' APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET EAST OF RUNWAY 5/23 AT LBE. LOCATION IS NORTHEAST OF TAXIWAY KILO. AREA IS FILLED ALMOST YEAR ROUND WITH WATER RUNOFF. CATTAIL AND WEED VEGETATION FILLS 'POND' AREA. AREA FILLED WITH FROGS AND INSECTS (MAINLY MOSQUITOS). EXTREMELY LARGE FLOCKS OF BIRDS ARE CONSTANTLY IN THIS POND AREA. SIZE VARIES FROM BLACKBIRD SIZE TO LARGE RAPTOR. WITH A LARGE CORPORATE JET BASE; A FAR 121 AIR CARRIER SERVICE (5 TO 7 FLIGHTS PER DAY) AND 141 FLIGHT SCHOOL ALONG WITH LARGE GA AIRCRAFT POPULATION A SERIOUS SAFETY ISSUE ARISES. BOTH TOWER AND ATIS ADVISE OF BIRD ACTIVITY. SO WE KNOW AIRPORT IS AWARE OF PROBLEM ON EVERY TAKEOFF NO MATTER SIZE OF AIRCRAFT; BIRD FLOCKS OR INDIVIDUAL BIRDS ARISE FROM THIS AREA AND ON MOST OCCASIONS FLY TOWARD RUNWAY. ON RECENT AFTERNOON ON 3 SEPARATE TAKEOFFS I FULLY EXPECTED TO HAVE COLLISION. LUCKILY NONE OCCURRED. I FEEL THIS SITUATION IS INTOLERABLE AND AN ACCIDENT WAITING TO OCCUR. SOLUTION: FILL SAID AREA ELIMINATING BUGS WHICH ELIMINATED FOOD WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE BIRDS IN THIS AREA. I DO NOT CARE OF EPA AND OR PENNA DNR REGULATIONS. HUMAN LIFE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN A CATTAIL OR BIRD.,An LBE based pilot described the 'settlement pond' east of Taxiway A between Taxiway K and the Southwest end of the terminal ramp. The pond is a bird feeding area attracting birds which become threats for aircraft departing Runway 5/23.,2015,09
101,201509,WEST VIRGINIA,ON APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILE STRAIGHT-IN FINAL TO HTS RUNWAY 12 AT 800 FEET AGL I SAW AN OBJECT JUST TO THE LEFT OF MY FLIGHT PATH.  FOR THE FIRST SECOND I THOUGHT IT WAS A BIRD; BUT I QUICKLY REALIZED THAT THE OBJECT WAS STATIONARY.  WITHIN ANOTHER COUPLE OF SECONDS I RECOGNIZED IT TO BE MAN-MADE.WE ULTIMATELY DESCENDED UNDER THE OBJECT WITHOUT CHANGING OUR FLIGHT PATH OR DESCENT RATE; AT ITS CLOSEST IT WAS APPROX 20 FEET ABOVE AND 20 FEET OFF MY LEFT WING.  IT APPEARED TO BE A KITE; WITH A TAIL.  I ALSO THOUGHT I SAW A FLASH OF LIGHT GLINT OFF THE STRING.  HOWEVER; GIVEN THE VERY SHORT TIME THE OBJECT WAS IN VIEW; IT COULD ALSO HAVE BEEN A POWERED UAV.I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE NEAR-MISS TO HTS TOWER; AND ALSO TO HTS DEPARTURE CONTROL ABOUT 30 MINUTES LATER WHEN I DEPARTED THE AIRPORT.,A Pilot on final approach to HTS at 800 feet reported a near miss with what appeared to be a kite but may have been a UAS.,2015,09
102,201510,CALIFORNIA,ON TAKEOFF ROLL AT ABOUT THE TIME I (PM) WOULD CALL 80 KNOTS; I NOTICED A LARGE BIRD SITTING ON THE RUNWAY. THE BIRD APPEARED TO BE A VERY LARGE HAWK. THE BIRD INSTEAD OF FLYING AWAY FROM US TURNED AND FLEW RIGHT INTO THE NUMBER TWO ENGINE. THERE WAS A LOUD POP AND THE AIRCRAFT SIMULTANEOUSLY VEERED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT. I GLANCED AT THE AIRSPEED INDICATOR AND INITIATED A REJECT. WE CAME TO A VERY QUICK STOP AS THE ANTI-SKID CYCLED THE BRAKES. THE FO NOW PM; INSTRUCTED THE CREW AND PASSENGERS TO REMAIN SEATED AS I INFORMED THE TOWER OF OUR SITUATION. WE TAXIED CLEAR AT THE NEXT INTERSECTION; WHICH HAD TO BE FOXTROT AS IT PUT US ON YANKEE RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE HIGH NUMBER GATES. I SHUT NUMBER TWO DOWN ON YANKEE AS THE ODOR IN THE CABIN QUICKLY BECAME EVIDENT.WE DISCUSSED OUR SITUATION AGAIN AND AGREED TO CHECK THE [PERFORMANCE COMPUTER] FOR BRAKE TEMPERATURE RESTRICTIONS. WE BECAME DISTRACTED BY GROUND CONTROL COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPANY RADIO AS WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO RETURN TO THE GATE. WE DIDN'T LOOK AT THE [PERFORMANCE COMPUTER] UNTIL WE WERE AT THE GATE. I REMEMBERED SEEING THE AIRSPEED INDICATOR PASSING THROUGH 100 KNOTS AS I PULLED THE THRUST LEVERS BACK SO I HAD HIM CHECK 120; 110; AND 100 KNOTS IN THE [PERFORMANCE COMPUTER]. 120 WOULD HAVE HAD US NOT RETURN TO THE GATE; 110 KNOTS INDICATED 60 MINUTES AT THE GATE; AND 100 KNOTS INDICATED NO RESTRICTION. I AM NOT SURE WHY WE MISSED CHECKING THE [PERFORMANCE COMPUTER] EARLIER AS IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS THAT I THOUGHT OF AS WE CAME TO A STOP.,A B737 flight crew reported a bird strike during the takeoff roll; damaging one of the engines. The takeoff was safely aborted and the aircraft returned to the gate for maintenance action.,2015,10
103,201510,COLORADO,WE WERE LANDING AT DEN WITH THE FO HAND FLYING IN VMC. AT 1000 AGL APPROXIMATELY 3 MILES OUT A LARGE YELLOW DRONE (APPROXIMATELY 4 FEET ACROSS) FLEW RIGHT UNDERNEATH OUR AIRCRAFT. IT WAS ABOUT 50 FEET BELOW US. WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO MANEUVER THE AIRCRAFT AT ALL IN AN AVOIDANCE MANEUVER. FROM THE TIME I SAW IT TO IT FLASHING UNDER THE NOSE WAS ABOUT TWO SECONDS. IT APPEARED TO BANK TO THE RIGHT (WEST) AS IT FLEW UNDER US. WE LANDED UNEVENTFULLY.,Flight crew on final at DEN reported a near miss with a drone at 1000 feet AGL.,2015,10
104,201510,GEORGIA,DURING OUR DESCENT ON THE KOLTT ONE RNAV ARRIVAL AND JUST BEFORE CROSSING ERLIN; WE ENCOUNTERED THE WAKE OF THE AIRCRAFT PRECEDING US. THE WAKE TURBULENCE WAS THE SECOND WORST I HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED. WE LATER FOUND OUT THAT THE AIRCRAFT AHEAD WAS A B767. OUR CRJ900 ROLLED ABRUPTLY AND VIOLENTLY TO THE RIGHT ABOUT 30 TO 40 DEGREES. I DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPILOT AND MUSCLED THE AIRPLANE BACK TO LEVEL. WHEN THE WAKE TURBULENCE EVENT WAS OVER; I QUICKLY CALLED THE CABIN TO SEE IF THE FAS WERE OK. I THEN MADE A PA TO THE PASSENGERS TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE EVENT AND EXPLAIN WHAT HAD HAPPENED.AT ABOUT THAT TIME CENTER SWITCHED US TO ATL APPROACH CONTROL. WE CHECKED IN BUT I REALLY DIDN'T HEAR THE CONTROLLER ASSIGN US A RUNWAY LIKE THEY USUALLY DO. WE HAD PLANNED FOR RWY 8L AND HAD IT PROGRAMMED IN THE FMS. WE WERE BOTH SO FRAZZLED BY THE BRUTAL WAKE TURBULENCE THAT EVEN IF THE CONTROLLER HAD ASSIGNED US A RWY; WE DID NOT HEAR IT OR READ IT BACK. IF MY FO READ IT BACK; I DID NOT HEAR IT. HE DOESN'T REMEMBER A RWY ASSIGNED EITHER; (A FEW WEEKS AGO; AN APPROACH CONTROLLER FAILED TO ASSIGN US A RWY ON INITIAL CHECK-IN). I WAS ABOUT TO ASK MY FO TO QUERY THE CONTROLLER ABOUT WHICH RWY WE COULD EXPECT WHEN THE CONTROLLER ASKED US TO DESCEND TO 8;000 FT AND WERE WE GOING TO NAVVY INTERSECTION. I QUICKLY PROGRAMMED THE ILS TO 9R IN THE FMS WHICH BROUGHT UP THE NAVVY WAYPOINT AND TURNED THE AIRPLANE TOWARDS THE FIX. THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED WE HAD EITHER NOT BEEN ASSIGNED A RWY; OR NOT HEARD IT/READ IT BACK; OR HEARD IT AND READ IT BACK BUT DIDN'T TAKE ACTION ON IT BECAUSE THE WAKE HAD JARRED US SO BADLY. THIS WHOLE EVENT FROM THE TIME OF ENCOUNTERING THE WAKE TO TURNING TOWARDS NAVVY TOOK PLACE IN THE SPAN OF 3 OR 4 MINUTES.THREATS: THE WAKE TURBULENCE; THE KOLTT ARRIVAL FLIGHT PATH BEING RUNWAY DEPENDENT. THE FACT THAT OUR HANDS WERE FULL RIGHT WHEN FREQUENCY SWITCH OCCURRED.ERRORS: I DON'T KNOW IF THE CONTROLLER ASSIGNED US A RUNWAY. HE PROBABLY DID; BUT IT WAS LOST ON US. ANOTHER ERROR WAS THAT I HAD SUSPECTED WE MIGHT ENCOUNTER WAKE TURBULENCE; BUT EARLIER AND CLOSER TO CHATTANOOGA. ATC WANTED US TO FLY FAST AND ASKED US TO KEEP OUR SPEED UP AS LONG AS WE COULD UNTIL WE HAD TO SLOW DOWN TO MAKE THE CROSSING RESTRICTION OF 250 KTS AT ERLIN. WE COMPLIED BUT THAT PUT US ONLY 7-8 MILES BEHIND THE 767. I FELT UNCOMFORTABLE WHEN TCAS SHOWED HIM AT LESS THAN THE USUAL 10 MILE SEPARATION DESCENDING ON THE ARRIVAL.UAS: A POSSIBLE COURSE DEVIATION FROM WHAT THE CONTROLLER EXPECTED FROM US.I WILL RAISE A CONCERN WITH ATC ABOUT THE PROXIMITY OF THE TRAFFIC AHEAD ON THE ARRIVAL. BY THE WAY; I HAVE HAD MORE COMBINED WAKE TURBULENCE ENCOUNTERS DESCENDING INTO ATL IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS THAN I HAVE IN THE LAST NEARLY 20 YEARS OF FLYING HERE. I WILL MOST CERTAINLY QUERY THE CONTROLLER PROMPTLY IN THE FUTURE IF A RUNWAY ISN'T ASSIGNED ON INITIAL CHECK-IN; BECAUSE THE ARRIVAL FLIGHT PATH IS RUNWAY DEPENDENT.,CRJ-900 flight crew reported encountering wake turbulence on arrival to ATL in trail of a B767 which distracted the crew enough that they missed a clearance.,2015,10
105,201510,NEW JERSEY,NEWARK AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL ANNOUNCED A DRONE WAS IN THE VICINITY OF THE EWR AIRPORT. THE FIRST OFFICER WAS FLYING THE AIRCRAFT FOR LANDING ON RUNWAY 4R FOLLOWING THE ILS GLIDE PATH. WE WERE LOOKING FOR THE DRONE AND AS I WAS SETTING THE FLAPS AS REQUESTED BY THE FIRST OFFICER; THE FIRST OFFICER SAW THE DRONE MOMENTARILY AS IT FLEW ABOVE OUR AIRCRAFT. I DID NOT SEE IT AND NEITHER DID THE OTHER FIRST OFFICER (WE WERE ON AN INTERNATIONAL FLIGHT AND SO WE HAD A CREW OF 3). WE LANDED THE AIRCRAFT SAFELY AND THE REST OF THE FLIGHT WAS NORMAL.,A heavy jet at 1;500 feet on the EWR Runway 4R ILS reported a UAS passed overhead their aircraft.,2015,10
106,201510,NEW JERSEY,NEAR MISS WITH DRONE; WHILE ON FINAL APPROACH TO 04R WE SAW A DRONE ABOUT 1-200 FEET BELOW US BARELY OFF CENTERLINE OF 4R. WE WERE AT 2000 FEET AND CLEARED FOR ILS 4R HAD WE BEEN 200 FEET LOWER WE WOULD HAVE HIT THE DRONE. IT WAS REPORTED BY SEVERAL OTHER AIRCRAFT PRIOR TO OUR SIGHTING. I MADE PHONE CALL TO TRACON AS REQUESTED AND SUBSEQUENTLY GOT A FEW MORE CALLS THROUGHOUT THE DAY FROM DEPT OF HOMELAND SECURITY.,A heavy jet Captain on final to EWR 4R reported an Unmanned Aircraft System near miss at 2;000 feet when the craft passed beneath their aircraft.,2015,10
107,201510,NEW JERSEY,ON DEPARTURE FROM NEWARK WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO TURN LEFT TO 270 AND CLIMB TO 4;000 FEET. SHORTLY AFTERWARD ATC ANNOUNCED TRAFFIC AT 4;500 FEET AND 12 O'CLOCK. ABOUT THE TIME WE SPOTTED THE TRAFFIC; AND ANNOUNCED IT 'IN SIGHT'; WE RECEIVED A TCAS TRAFFIC ALERT. WE SHALLOWED CLIMB BUT STILL RECEIVED A TCAS 'ADJUST VERTICAL SPEED' WARNING. WE CONTINUED TO SHALLOW AND ENDED UP DESCENDING BACK TO APPROXIMATELY 3;800 FEET BEFORE RECEIVING A 'CLEAR OF CONFLICT' MESSAGE. WE STARTED CLIMBING BACK TO 4;000 FEET AND INFORMED ATC THAT WE HAD DESCENDED TO AVOID TRAFFIC. WE WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CLEARED DIRECT PARKE AND THE REST OF THE DEPARTURE WAS UNEVENTFUL.THREAT/UAS: CLEARED TO CLIMB WITHIN 500 FEET OF KNOWN TRAFFIC WITHOUT HORIZONTAL SPACING VECTOR. MORE AGGRESSIVE 'SEE AND AVOID' RESPONSE.,Pilot reported being issued traffic and observed the traffic. Aircraft received an RA and aircraft descended to avoid traffic. After traffic passed the aircraft climbed back to assigned altitude. Pilot advised ATC of altitude deviation for traffic.,2015,10
108,201510,NEW YORK,ON THE LENDY ARRIVAL FROM LGA [VOR]; EAST OF JFK; TO [THE] SOUTH OF JFK; TO A WESTBOUND HEADING TO THE JERSEY SHORE DESCENDING TO 3;000 FEET. I FLEW UP THE JERSEY SHORELINE AT 3;000 FEET TO AN INTERCEPT HEADING TO ILS 4R AT JFK AT 25-30 MILES FROM JFK. I WAS DESCENDED TO 2;000 FEET ON BASE TO FINAL AT APPROXIMATELY 25 MILES OUT. AT 2;000 FEET; FLAPS 2; 160 KNOTS; ON LOCALIZER; PRIOR TO GS INTERCEPT AND APPROXIMATELY 10 TO 8 MILES FROM THE RUNWAY; WE STRUCK THE FIRST BIRD ON THE CAPTAIN'S L1 WINDOW NEAR THE CENTER POST. A QUICK CHECK OF THE ENGINES INDICATED NO ABNORMAL CONDITION. WITHIN ONE MINUTE WE STRUCK THE SECOND BIRD AT 2;000 FEET WITH A LOUD BANG FROM THE FRONT OF THE AIRCRAFT; BUT COULD NOT SEE THE STRIKE. THE ENGINES; AGAIN CHECKED NORMAL. WE NOTIFIED THE JFK CONTROL TOWER TO WARN THE AIRCRAFT BEHIND US. I CONTINUED THE APPROACH FOR AN UNEVENTFUL FLAPS 3 LANDING AT JFK ON 4R. I CALLED JFK TOWER ON THE PHONE AFTER GATE ARRIVAL TO RELAY THERE WAS NO APPARENT DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT; BUT WE HAD TWO BIRD STRIKES. ONE ON THE CAPTAIN'S L1 WINDOW AND ONE ON THE RADOME AT THE 1 TO 2 O'CLOCK POSITION; UNDER THE R1 WINDOW. JFK TOWER TOLD ME 5 AIRCRAFT AFTER ME WERE INVOLVED IN BIRD STRIKES ON THE SAME ILS 4R APPROACH. I RECOMMENDED THAT THE TOWER ASK APPROACH TO BRING AIRCRAFT IN AT 3;000 FEET TO GLIDE SLOPE INTERCEPT IN AN ATTEMPT TO MISS THE FLOCK(S) OF BIRDS ON RUNWAY 4R AT THE LOWER 2;000 FEET. JFK WAS LANDING BOTH 4L AND 4R. JFK [COMPANY OPS] INSPECTED THE AIRCRAFT.,An Airbus flight crew reported a double bird strike while conducting a night approach. There was no apparent damage to either engine or the airframe and an uneventful landing was accomplished.,2015,10
109,201510,TEXAS,I DID NOT CALL THE TOWER BEFORE LANDING. I WAS DISTRACTED BY APPROACH TELLING US TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR A [UAV] ON FINAL; AND SEEING THREE BIG BIRDS ABOVE US ON FINAL JUST MISS US.,Flight crew failed to call Tower and landed without a clearance due to a distraction of Approach Controller advising them about possible UAV traffic and birds on final.,2015,10
110,201510,TEXAS,AIRCRAFT Y RADAR IDENTIFIED AND VECTORED FOR TAZ RWY31L NGP. AIRCRAFT Z RADAR IDENTIFIED AND VECTORED ASR RWY31L NGP. AIRCRAFT X RELEASED PREDATOR 2 DEPARTURE. AIRCRAFT X RADAR IDENTIFIED AND ALTITUDE VERIFIED. AIRCRAFT X OBSERVED AT 3000. AIRCRAFT X OBSERVED AND VERIFIED DESCENDING. AIRCRAFT X REPORTS CLIMBING BACK TO 3000. AIRCRAFT X INSTRUCTED TO EXPEDITE CLIMB TO 3000. TRAFFIC ISSUED TO AIRCRAFT Z. AIRCRAFT Z REPORTS TRAFFIC IN SIGHT AND AIRCRAFT X OBSERVED LEVEL AT 3000.,CRP Controller observed an UAV aircraft that was assigned 3;000 feet descend into the vicinity of another aircraft under his control. Controller observes the UAV aircraft climb back up to 3;000. Traffic was issued to all concerned.,2015,10
111,201511,GEORGIA,WHILE BEING VECTORED INTO FTY BY ATLANTA APPROACH WE WERE VECTORED TO SEQUENCE US BEHIND A SLOWER AIRCRAFT. AS WE WERE BEING SWITCHED FROM ATLANTA APPROACH TO FTY TOWER AND CLEARED FOR THE VISUAL RUNWAY 26 WE WERE TOO CLOSE TO THE RUNWAY AND TOO HIGH TO CONTINUE STRAIGHT IN SO WE TURNED OUT TO A LONGER BASE AND SQUARED THE TURN TO FINAL. WHILE BEING TOLD TO SWITCH TO 118.45; FTY TOWER FREQUENCY; A DRONE WAS NOTICED PASSING BELOW US AND TO THE LEFT. WE MADE MENTION OF IT AND NOW WERE A BIT NERVOUS AND ON EXTRA HIGH ALERT KEEPING AN EYE OUT FOR ANOTHER THAT MIGHT BE IN THE AREA. DURING THIS TIME WE WERE ALSO HAVING TO EXECUTE AN ACCELERATED APPROACH (ADDING FLAPS AND GEAR IN A MUCH MORE COMPRESSED TIME FRAME DUE TO BEING CLOSER THAN NORMAL TO THE AIRPORT). WHEN ON SHORT FINAL (AROUND 1 MILE) AND APPROXIMATELY 300 FT I LOOKED AT THE RADIO AND NOTICED TOWER FREQUENCY; 118.45 HAD BEEN TYPED IN BUT WE HAD NOT SWITCHED OVER TO IT FROM ATLANTA APPROACH. I QUICKLY MADE IT KNOWN TO THE OTHER PILOT AND IMMEDIATELY SWITCHED AND CALLED TOWER. TOWER CLEARED US TO LAND AND UPON LANDING ASKED US TO CALL THE TOWER WHEN WE WERE DONE. I CALLED THE TOWER ONCE OUR PASSENGERS HAD LEFT AND CONVEYED THE ENTIRE STORY TO HIM AS WELL; EXPLAINING HOW THE COMPRESSED TIMEFRAME AND THE SPOTTING OF A DRONE CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT LED TO BEING DISTRACTED AND FORGETTING TO SWITCH UNTIL SHORT FINAL. THIS SITUATION WAS CAUSED BY ALLOWING EXTRA DISTRACTIONS TAKE FOCUS AWAY FROM THE IMMEDIATE ISSUES AT HAND. THE OTHER PILOT WAS FLYING SO THE ACCELERATED APPROACH WAS IN HIS CONTROL AND THE DRONE SITING HAD PASSED BUT I WAS DISTRACTED THINKING ABOUT THOSE THINGS BEHIND ME INSTEAD OF WHAT WAS IN FRONT OF ME.,BE40 First Officer reported sighting a drone during a visual approach to FTY. Due to the distraction; switching to the Tower was overlooked until very short final.,2015,11
112,201511,ILLINOIS,UAS OPERATIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH COA/333. MODE-C TRANSPONDER (30 MILE/MODE C VEIL) NOT REQUIRED BY 91.215 EXEMPTION DUE TO OPERATIONS IN CLASS G AIRSPACE (NOTIFICATION NOT REQUIRED).,A CyPhy PARC UAS pilot reported giving a demonstration flight beneath ORD Class B airspace up to 65 feet AGL without a transponder.,2015,11
113,201511,ILLINOIS,A HELICOPTER WAS FLYING VFR SOUTHBOUND NOT IN COMMUNICATION WITH AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL. THE PILOT CHECKED WITH CPS TOWER AND REPORTED A NEAR MISS UAS INCIDENT. THE AIRCRAFT WAS AT 1;400 FT AND 7 NW OF CPS. THE PILOT REPORTED THAT THE DRONE WAS LESS THAN 100 FT FROM THE HELICOPTER AND HAD TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION WITH A 60 DEGREE BANKING TURN TO AVOID THE DRONE. THERE WAS NO REPORTED DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT AND CREW WAS NOT INJURED. THE COLOR OF THE UAS WAS REPORTED AS BLACK AND GREY; 3X3 FT; 4 PROPELLERS WITH BALLOONS ON TOP. LAW ENFORCEMENT WAS CONTACTED AND POLICE DISPATCHED. UAS CHECKLIST WAS FOLLOWED AND COMPLETED. ACN AND NO FURTHER INCIDENT OCCURRED.ADD LAW ENFORCEMENT PROCEDURES TO CHECKLIST. I WAS ALSO NOT SURE OF WHAT WAS TO BE EXPECTED OF ME WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT. I USED MY BEST JUDGMENT AND HAD THE POLICE DISPATCH CARS TO THE POSSIBLE SCENE FROM WHERE THE UAS WAS LAUNCHED.,A helicopter pilot called ATC after a NMAC with an UAS at 1;400 feet over the STL metropolitan area.,2015,11
114,201511,INDIANA,WHILE TAXIING TO RUNWAY 23 ON TAXIWAY E; I NOTICED A SMALL WHITE OBJECT FLOATING APPROXIMATELY 1-2 MILES NORTH/NORTHEAST OF THE AIRPORT AT APPROXIMATELY 2;000 AGL. IT WAS MOVING VERY SLOWLY; APPROXIMATELY 15 KNOTS ON ABOUT A 130-DEGREE TRACK. IT APPEARED TO BE A FEW FEET IN DIAMETER WITH AN ELLIPTICAL SHAPE.I QUERIED THE TOWER CONTROLLER TO ASK IF THE FACILITY WAS AWARE OF WHAT THE OBJECT WAS. THE CONTROLLER WAS UNAWARE OF THE OBJECT'S PRESENCE. UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION; THE CONTROLLER INFORMED ME THAT IT APPEARED TO BE A BALLOON WITH SOME SORT OF DEVICE TETHERED AND FREELY SWINGING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE BALLOON.THIS WAS CONSISTENT WITH MY OBSERVATION. A BRIGHT LIGHT OR PERHAPS THE SUN'S REFLECTION WOULD ILLUMINATE OFF OF THE METALLIC OBJECT AT THE BOTTOM OF THE BALLOON. I HAVE SEEN THIS OBJECT ONCE BEFORE ABOUT 4 MONTHS AGO ON THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE TO RUNWAY 10 AT THIS AIRPORT. THE CONTROLLER IN THAT SITUATION WAS ALSO UNAWARE OF WHAT IT WAS.,A C172 pilot reports sighting an object in the sky while taxiing to Runway 23 at LAF. The Tower is also able to see the object which appears to be a balloon with a metallic object swinging below. The Tower Controller was initially unaware of the object and it appeared to be in the Class D airspace.,2015,11
115,201511,INDIANA,I HAD AIRCRAFT X ON A 340 HEADING FOR THE RNAV 18 APPROACH TO OXI. HE WAS APPROXIMATELY 9-10 NM NE OF THE AIRPORT AT 2900-3000 FT. HE REPORTED THAT A DRONE CAME VERY CLOSE TO HIM; ABOUT A COUPLE HUNDRED FEET TO THE WEST. I ASKED HIM FOR ANY OF THE DETAILS THAT HE COULD GIVE ME ABOUT IT. IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME ALTITUDE HE REPORTED. I LET HIM CONTINUE TO FLY AND START THE APPROACH. I TOOK DOWN HIS PHONE NUMBER TO GET MORE INFORMATION ONCE HE WAS ON THE GROUND. I TOLD THE CIC WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND HE CALLED ROC. AFTER I WAS OFF POSITION; I TALKED TO ROC AND CALLED THE PILOT BACK TO TRY TO GATHER A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION. PILOT HAD HIS WIFE WITH HIM AND SHE SAID IT WAS RED AND BLACK IN COLOR AND THE PILOT SAID IT WAS TOUGH TO TELL BUT MAYBE 2 FT IN DIAMETER. HE DIDN'T TAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT ACTION BECAUSE IT WOULD'VE BEEN TOO LATE. THERE WAS NOTHING THAT SHOWED UP ON RADAR.,Approach Controller is advised by a pilot on approach to Runway 24 at OXI of a drone sighting at 3000 feet. No evasive action is taken.,2015,11
116,201511,NEVADA,WE HAD JUST PASSED ROPPR; BEEN CLEARED DIRECT TO WILLW; AND WERE CLIMBING THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 11;000 FEET MSL WHEN I NOTICED TWO CONTRAILS AHEAD OF AND BELOW US TO THE SOUTHEAST. FOR A BRIEF SECOND; I THOUGHT THEY MIGHT BE A COUPLE OF USAF THUNDERBIRDS; WHO ARE BASED AT NEARBY NELLIS AFB; PRACTICING OVER THE DESERT. HOWEVER; IT QUICKLY BECAME APPARENT THAT THESE WERE INSTEAD TWO ROCKETS RAPIDLY ASCENDING TOWARDS OUR ALTITUDE AT AN ESTIMATED DISTANCE OF TWO TO THREE MILES AWAY.I QUICKLY ADVISED THE CAPTAIN (PM) WHO SOUNDED SKEPTICAL SO I CLICKED OFF THE AUTOPILOT AND ROLLED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT AT WHICH POINT HE SPOTTED THE FIRST TWO CONTRAILS JUST AS A THIRD ROCKET WAS FIRED OUT OF THE DESERT BELOW. LIKE THE OTHERS; IT TOOK JUST SECONDS FOR ITS MOTOR TO BURN OUT; AT AN ESTIMATED 7;000 FEET TO 9;000 FEET; AFTER WHICH WE WERE UNABLE TO TRACK THE ROCKET ITSELF. BUT; GIVEN THE SPEED AT WHICH THEY WERE REACHING SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET; IT SEEMS LIKELY THAT THEIR TRAJECTORIES TOOK THEM AT LEAST A FEW THOUSAND FEET HIGHER.IN FACT; HAD WE NOT BEEN GIVEN AN EARLY TURN BY ATC TOWARDS THE WILLW FIX; AND STAYED ON THE PUBLISHED DEPARTURE; WE BOTH THINK; GIVEN THE ROCKETS' ESTIMATED ALTITUDES AND POSITIONS; THAT THEIR TRACKS COULD EASILY BEEN AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO US; OR TO OTHER AIRCRAFT OF THE TRALR6 DEPARTURE. AS IT WAS; THE SIGHT OF ROCKETS STREAKING UP TOWARDS OUR GENERAL VICINITY WAS STILL SOMEWHAT CONCERNING.AS WE TRIED TO ASCERTAIN THE POSITION FROM WHICH THE ROCKETS WERE BEING LAUNCHED AND GET A BETTER FIX ON WHERE THEY WERE HEADING ONCE IN FLIGHT; A FOURTH WAS FIRED; AND FOLLOWED A TRACK ROUGHLY PARALLEL TO THE FIRST THREE. ALTHOUGH WE CAN'T SAY CONCLUSIVELY; IT APPEARED THAT THE ROCKETS WERE FIRED FROM EVENLY SPACED; MULTIPLE LOCATIONS; STARTING FROM WEST TO EAST; ALONG A LINE THAT SEEMED TO RUN VERY NEARLY DIRECTLY UNDER THE DEPARTURE PATH BETWEEN THE CEASR AND FORGE WAYPOINTS.BY NOW; LESS THAN A MINUTE HAD PROBABLY PASSED SINCE THE FIRST TWO CONTRAILS HAD BEEN SIGHTED; AND I'LL PERSONALLY ADMIT TO HAVING BEEN A BIT MESMERIZED BY A SIGHT THAT FEW WILL EVER WITNESS OUTSIDE OF COMBAT. AT THAT POINT CAPTAIN SAID; 'WE'VE GOT TO TELL ATC;' WHICH HE IMMEDIATELY DID; IN A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE SITUATION. AS HE WAS TALKING; I WAS LOOKING OUT AT THE CONTRAILS; WHICH WERE NOW TOPPING OUT WELL BELOW AND BEHIND US AS WE CONTINUED OUR CLIMB THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 14;000 FEET; AT WHICH POINT A FIFTH AND FINAL (AT LEAST TO OUR KNOWLEDGE) ROCKET CAME SHOOTING OUT OF THE DESERT. UNLIKE THE FIRST FOUR; I NOTICED THIS ROCKET MADE A QUICK CORKSCREW DURING THE MIDDLE OF ITS ASCENT; WHICH REMINDED ME OF THE ROCKETS WE USED TO BUILD AND FIRE AS CHILDREN; ALBEIT MUCH MORE POWERFUL.AFTER I TOLD THE CAPTAIN (PM) ABOUT THE FIFTH LAUNCH; HE QUICKLY NOTIFIED THE DEPARTURE CONTROLLER WHO VERY SHORTLY AFTERWARD PASSED US OFF TO LA CENTER. THE REMAINDER OF THE FLIGHT PROCEEDED UNEVENTFULLY; ALTHOUGH WE HAD A PROLONGED ACARS EXCHANGE WITH DISPATCH IN WHICH WE DESCRIBED THE EVENT TO THEM.IN ADDITION; AS WE WERE PASSING THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 16;000 FEET TO 17;000 FEET; THE CAPTAIN ASKED IF I COULD STILL SEE THE CONTRAILS. I COULD JUST MAKE THEM OUT SO HE HANDED ME HIS IPAD/EFB WITH WHICH I MANAGED TO GET ONE PHOTO. AT THAT POINT WE WERE WELL ABOVE AND AHEAD OF THE REMAINING CONTRAIL SMOKE; WHICH WAS NOW DISPERSING IN THE MID-LEVEL WINDS. SO; WHILE THE PHOTO DOES NOT CONVEY THE POWERFUL IMPRESSION THE ROCKETS MADE WHEN WE WERE MUCH NEARER TO THEIR TRACKS; IT DOES CLEARLY SHOW FEATURES ON THE GROUND WHICH MIGHT HELP INVESTIGATORS NARROW DOWN THE LOCATION FROM WHICH THE ROCKETS WERE LAUNCHED; THAT LOCATION BEING A POTENTIALLY EVEN GREATER HAZARD TO AIRCRAFT ARRIVING AND DEPARTING FROM HND THAN TO THOSE FROM LAS.,Airline crew departing LAS in vicinity of ROPPR intersection encountered several rocket launches that were a distraction and potential hazard.,2015,11
117,201511,NEW YORK,ON FINAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 31R AROUND 1;000 FEET MSL; I SAW TWO WHITE DRONES ON THE LEFT SIDE OF OUR AIRCRAFT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING. I WAS ABLE TO SEE THEM CLEARLY SO THEY MUST HAVE BEEN AROUND 200 TO 300 FEET AWAY FROM US. THEY WERE TYPICAL RECREATIONAL TYPE DRONES WITH FOUR PROPS. WE PASSED THEM IN A FEW SECONDS AND DIDN'T HAVE TO ALTER THE PATH. I NOTIFIED THE JFK TOWER IMMEDIATELY. WE LANDED UNEVENTFULLY.THE AUTHORITIES WILL HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS 'DRONE' PROBLEM. IT IS BECOMING OUT OF CONTROL.,An air carrier Captain on JFK Runway 31R final at about 1;000 feet reported two UAS aircraft hovering about 200-300 feet away from them and left of the final approach course. Evasive action was not required.,2015,11
118,201511,PENNSYLVANIA,AFTER DEPARTING AGC; WE ENCOUNTERED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SMALL DRONE APPROXIMATELY 6 NM NW OF AGC; DIRECTLY ACROSS HEINZ FIELD ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE OHIO RIVER. WE WERE AT 2000 FT MSL WHEN WE SPOTTED THE SMALL 'OBJECT' APPROXIMATELY 200 FT OFF OUR PORT SIDE. THE OBJECT WAS SILVER AND WAS REFLECTIVE. IT APPEARED TO BE HEADING ON A SE COURSE BEFORE IT EXECUTED A SLIGHT LEFT BANK TO THE EAST. WE ONLY SAW THE OBJECT FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 SEC BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED BEHIND OUR AIRCRAFT. I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED APPROACH AND RELAYED THE SAME INFO. AFTER AN UNEVENTFUL FLIGHT; I CALLED APPROACH AND BASICALLY REPEATED THE SAME INFO THAT I HAD PASSED OVER THE RADIO. THEY TOLD ME THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THAT AREA HAD BEEN NOTIFIED.,A helicopter pilot near AGC reported a small UAS 200 feet away from his aircraft while cruising at 2000 feet MSL.,2015,11
119,201511,SOUTH CAROLINA,DURING OUR DEPARTURE BRIEF WE DISCUSSED AT LENGTH THE 2 NOTAMS AT HXD THAT WOULD PREVENT US FROM LANDING AT NIGHT ON RWY 3 (FAVORED RUNWAY BY THE CURRENT WIND). WE RAN AN IPREFLIGHT BOOK TO DETERMINE EFFECT OF LANDING WITH A TAILWIND AND THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES IF IT SHOULD BE RAINING AT ARRIVAL TIME ADDING THE 15% LPA. AS A CREW WE AGREED IT TO BE SAFE TO DEPART AND TO LAND WITH THE TAILWIND ON RWY 21. AT AROUND 75 MILES THE PILOT MONITORING (PM) OBTAINED THE ASOS FOR HXD; GPS RWY 3 WAS IN USE. I ASKED THE PM TO CALL HXD TOWER TO SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED LANDING ON RWY 3 SINCE IT WAS AFTER SUNSET AND THOSE APPROACHES WERE NOTAM'D NA. WHEN QUERIED; HXD TOWER SAID 'OH YEAH; I'LL SWITCH THAT AROUND BY THE TIME YOU GET HERE'. IN PLANNING OUR APPROACH WE DECIDED ON THE GPS 21 VS. LOC DME 21 AS IT WAS A SIMPLER APPROACH WITH OUR EQUIPMENT NOT REQUIRING A STEPDOWN FIX AND THE GPS WOULD COUNT DOWN THE DISTANCE TO THE RUNWAY FOR OUR VISUAL DESCENT POINT CALCULATIONS. BOUFORT APPROACH ASKED US WHAT TYPE APPROACH WE WOULD LIKE; WE ASKED FOR THE GPS 21; WE WERE THEN CLEARED DIRECT TO DORVE AND CLEARED FOR THE GPS 21. UPON SWITCHING TO TOWER OVER THE FAF; TOWER ASKED US 'CAN YOU SHOOT THE GPS 21 AT NIGHT?' WE LOOKED AT EACH OTHER; AGREED THAT THE NOTAMS WE REVIEWED WERE FOR RWY 3 AND SAID 'YES' TO THE TOWER WHO THEN CLEARED US TO LAND. I ASKED THE PM IF HE WAS COMFORTABLE CONTINUING THE APPROACH WITH A QUESTION LIKE THAT FROM TOWER AND HE SAID YES SO WE CONTINUED THE APPROACH AND LANDING WITHOUT EVENT.UPON LANDING WE CONTINUED TO DISCUSS THE EVENTS AND HOW THEY UNFOLDED AND REVIEWED THE NOTAMS YET AGAIN; THIS TIME WE REALIZED WE OVERLOOKED THE NOTAM FOR GPS 21 'PROCEDURE NA AT NIGHT'. IN LOOKING BACK WE DID EVERYTHING RIGHT. WE REVIEWED THE NOTAMS; DISCUSSED THE IMPACT OF A NIGHT LANDING WITH A TAILWIND; DISCUSSED WET RUNWAYS; CALCULATED PERFORMANCE USING IPREFLIGHT; THOROUGHLY BRIEFED THE APPROACH AND QUESTIONED ATC WHY THEY WERE FLYING APPROACHES TO THE WRONG RUNWAY 3 AT NIGHT. SO WHERE DID IT GO WRONG? THE ERROR STARTED WHEN WE BOTH OVERLOOKED THE NOTAM FOR GPS 21 WHICH WAS IN A DIFFERENT FORMAT THAN THE OTHER 2 NOTAMS; THE SECOND LINK WAS LOSING FAITH IN HXD TOWER WHO SAID 'OH YEAH; I'LL SWITCH THAT AROUND BY THE TIME YOU GET HERE' MAKING IT SEEM THAT HE WAS EVEN UNAWARE OF THE NIGHT NOTAM RESTRICTIONS TO RWY 3; THE 3RD LINK WAS BOUFORT APPROACH CLEARING US FOR THE GPS 21; THE 4TH LINK (AND THE CRITICAL ONE THAT SHOULD HAVE BROKEN THE CHAIN) WAS HXD TOWER ASKING US IF WE CAN SHOOT THE GPS 21 AT NIGHT. I THINK WE WOULD HAVE GIVEN HIS QUESTION A LITTLE MORE CREDIT IF HE WASN'T SURPRISED WHEN WE ASKED HIM WHY THEY WERE SHOOTING APPROACHES TO RWY 3. WE BOTH FELT CONFIDENT IN OUR PRE-DEPARTURE PLANNING SO WE DID NOT STOP TO INVESTIGATE HIS QUERY TO US. IN LOOKING BACK WE REALLY SHOULD HAVE STOPPED THE APPROACH AND RE-EVALUATED THE SITUATION PRIOR TO CONTINUING.,EMB505 Captain reported a night landing at HXD using the GPS 21 approach that was not authorized for night use.,2015,11
120,201512,FLORIDA,AS FIRST OFFICER WAS HAND FLYING AND INTERCEPTING THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE; HE ALERTED ME TO SOMETHING HE THOUGHT WAS A DRONE. I WAS TRYING TO IDENTIFY SOMETHING SLIGHTLY RIGHT OF THE NOSE AND HE DREW MY ATTENTION BACK TO THE LEFT AS TWO QUAD COPTER DRONES PASSED RIGHT TO LEFT OFF THE NOSE AND PASSED THE LEFT WINGTIP. THE DRONES HAD A WHITE BASE/BOTTOM WITH A DARK/BLACK ROTOR AREA. WE ESTIMATE THE DISTANCE FROM US WAS BETWEEN 200-300 FEET. I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED TOWER AND HE ALERTED THE AIRCRAFT BEHIND US TO THE THREAT. AFTER DISCUSSING THE EVENT ON THE GROUND; WE REALIZED THAT THE OBJECT ON THE RIGHT WAS ALSO LIKELY A THIRD DRONE. I NOTIFIED GROUND CONTROL THAT WE BELIEVED THERE WERE LIKELY THREE DRONES AND HE STATED THE AIRCRAFT FOLLOWING US HAD ALSO SEEN THE DRONES.,Air carrier crew on approach to RSW had several drones pass within 200-300 feet.,2015,12
121,201512,FLORIDA,WHILE ON THE ILS TO 17L IN MCO I WAS THE PILOT FLYING. THE FLIGHT CONDITIONS WERE VFR WITH A SCATTERED LAYER AT 4;000. I NOTICED A FEW LARGE BIRDS JUST OUT OF OUR FLIGHT PATH; THEN THE FIRST OFFICER AND I SAW WHAT WE BELIEVED TO BE A DRONE. IT WAS NOT A BIRD. IT WAS JUST ABOVE OUR FLIGHT PATH AT 2;500 FEET. WE WERE ON THE GLIDE PATH AT 2;350 FEET. THE DRONE WAS JUST TO THE RIGHT OF CENTER LINE BY ABOUT 50 FEET. THE COLOR WAS SILVER METALLIC AND IT HAD 4 LOBES JUST LIKE A LARGE HOBBY KIT DRONE. IT WAS STATIONARY AS WE PASSED IT AT APPROACH SPEED. IT COULD HAVE BEEN 4 SILVER BALLOONS ATTACHED TOGETHER BUT IT APPEARED TO BE MORE STATIONARY THAN DRIFTING WITH THE WIND. WE DID NOT NEED TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION; I HAD THE AUTOPILOT ON UNTIL WE WERE AT A LOWER ALTITUDE. WE REPORTED THE EVENT TO THE TOWER.,A flight crew experienced a UAV encounter while established on an ILS approach to Runway 17L at MCO.,2015,12
122,201512,FLORIDA,APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES OUT ON LEFT BASE TO RWY 14 AT APF AT 1000 FT MSL; THE PILOT FLYING IN THE LEFT SEAT REPORTED A CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH A DRONE. HE ESTIMATED IT AT ABOUT 100 FT BELOW US AND NOT MUCH MORE THAN A WINGSPAN TO OUR LEFT. HE DESCRIBED IT AS A QUAD COPTER WITH A BODY THAT HAD LONGITUDINAL STRIPES AS IF THEY WERE RIBS ON A WING. SUBSEQUENT ONLINE RESEARCH REVEALED A DRONE MEETING THAT DESCRIPTION - A 'DJI PHANTOM 3 PROFESSIONAL' DRONE. WE'RE NOT SURE THAT IS WHAT IT WAS; BUT IT HAD THAT LOOK. HE DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME TO WATCH IT AS HE WAS THE PILOT-FLYING; SO AS SOON AS HE REALIZED WE WERE PAST IT; HE REFOCUSED ON FLYING.WHILE NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS NECESSARY IN THIS SITUATION; THE DRONE WE ENCOUNTERED WAS CERTAINLY BETWEEN 800 AND 1000 FT MSL WELL WITHIN THE CLASS D AIRSPACE AT APF; AND MISSED US BY NO MORE THAN 100 FEET. WE REPORTED THE ENCOUNTER TO NAPLES ATCT AND THEY ADVISED AT LEAST A COUPLE OF AIRCRAFT WHO WERE FOLLOWING US ON THE APPROACH.,C182 Instructor reported a NMAC with a drone at 1;000 feet on left base to Runway 14 at APF.,2015,12
123,201512,NEW JERSEY,WHILE DESCENDING THROUGH 1200 FEET ON FINAL TO RUNWAY 22L EWR WE RECEIVED A TCAS TA OF TRAFFIC; I ASSUMED IT WAS A HELICOPTER BELOW. THE CAPTAIN AND JUMPSEATER OBSERVED OUT OF THE LEFT COCKPIT WINDOW TO OUR EAST TWO DRONES. THEY ESTIMATED THEM AT 1000 FEET AGL. I NEVER SAW THEM AND LANDED THE PLANE WITHOUT INCIDENT. WE REPORTED THIS TO TOWER SO THEY COULD ADVISE TRAFFIC BEHIND US.,B757 flight crew experienced a TCAS TA at 1200 feet on final approach to Runway 22L at EWR and assumes it is from a helicopter below. The Captain and a jumpseater note two drones on the left side and 200 feet lower. No evasive action is required.,2015,12
124,201512,NEW YORK,I WAS TEST OPERATING AN UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM (UAS); A DJI PHANTOM 3 PROFESSIONAL; WITHIN FLUSHING MEADOWS CORONA PARK IN QUEENS; NY. THIS FLIGHT WAS PURELY FOR HOBBY/RECREATIONAL PURPOSES (NON-COMMERCIAL OPERATION). IT IS LEGAL TO FLY UAS IN THIS PARK; HOWEVER; SINCE IT IS APPROXIMATELY 2 NM SOUTH OF LGA; I TELEPHONED THE TOWER ON MY INTENTIONS TO FLY FOR APPROXIMATELY 10 MINUTES AT OR BELOW 250 FEET AGL. THE TOWER OPERATOR THANKED ME FOR CALLING AND ASKED THAT I CALL BACK WHEN I WAS DONE WITH MY OPERATION.AFTER LANDING; I NOTICED A VOICEMAIL FROM LGA ATC REQUESTING THAT I CALL BACK; WHICH I PROMPTLY DID. THE CONTROLLER ASKED FOR MY NAME; TYPE OF AIRCRAFT FLOWN; AND THE DURATION OF THE FLIGHT. I PROVIDED THE CONTROLLER WITH MY INFORMATION AND HE THANKED ME. I WASN'T SURE IF I WAS IN VIOLATION OF ANY FARS; AS I HAD CALLED IN MY INTENTIONS; BUT I AM FILING THIS NOTICE AS A MATTER OF RECORD OF MY COMPLIANCE TO CONTACT ATC WHENEVER FLYING WITHIN 5 MILES OF AN AIRPORT; AND STAYING WELL BELOW 400 FEET AGL; AND AWAY FROM PEOPLE 2NM AND FURTHER FROM LGA. ON A GOOD NOTE; HAD I ATTEMPTED TO FLY ANY FURTHER NORTH; DJI HAS BUILT IN FIRMWARE INFORMING THE PILOT (ME) WHEN WITHIN 1.5 NM OF THE FIELD; CAUSING THE UAS TO LAND AUTOMATICALLY. THIS DID NOT OCCUR AS I DID REMAIN SOUTH.,A rated Private pilot reported flying his UAV in Corona Park; 2 NM south of LGA; with the Tower's permission.,2015,12
125,201512,PENNSYLVANIA,WHILE ON APPROACH TO PIT THE CAPTAIN NOTICED A DRONE AND CALLED ITS POSITION OUT. I LOOKED UP AND SAW A 4 BLADED DRONE WITH A CAMERA ATTACHED TO THE BOTTOM PASS NO MORE THAN 200 FT ABOVE AND TO THE LEFT OF THE AIRCRAFT. WE WERE DESCENDING THROUGH 5000 FT AT AROUND 250 KIAS ON THE VISUAL APPROACH.IT IS OBVIOUS THAT CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE COULD HAVE OCCURRED TO THE AIRCRAFT IF WE WOULD HAVE STRUCK THE DRONE. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT DRONES ARE NOT TO BE OPERATED ABOVE 400 FT AGL AND AT LEAST 5 SM OUTSIDE THE AREA OF AN AIRPORT. IF THIS IS THE LAW IT SHOULD BE ENFORCED.,CRJ200 First Officer reported sighting a drone with a camera attached at 5000 feet during a visual approach to PIT.,2015,12
126,201512,TEXAS,WE WERE ASSIGNED FL360 ON THE FLIGHT TO DFW. WHILE IN CRUISE; WE WERE WORKING OUR WAY AROUND A LINE OF THUNDERSTORM (TS). I WAS PILOT FLYING AND WE DEVIATED SOUTH TO AVOID TWO LARGE CELLS. AFTER DEVIATING SOUTH; WE WERE TOLD TO PROCEED DIRECT CLEWS ON THE KLNDR2 RNAV ARRIVAL. WE WERE BEGINNING TO TURN BACK TOWARD CLEWS WHEN WE THOUGHT WE WERE CLEAR OF THE WEATHER. ATC CONFIRMED THIS BY INSTRUCTING US THAT WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO TURN BACK TOWARD THE INTERSECTION IN ABOUT 2 MINUTES. AS WE CAME AROUND THE CORNER; WE ENCOUNTERED A LARGE BUILDUP/CELL THAT WAS NOT PAINTING ON OUR RADAR DUE TO THE SHADOW FROM THE FIRST STORM AND ALSO WAS NOT REPORTED BY ATC WHEN WE WERE ADVISED THAT OUR ROUTE LOOKED CLEAR. BY THE TIME WE WERE ABLE TO CLEARLY SEE IT; THERE WAS NO WAY TO AVOID IT. I PULLED THE THRUST BACK TO IDLE IN ORDER TO SLOW THE AIRCRAFT BELOW TURBULENT AIR PENETRATION SPEED IN A SHORT DISTANCE; SINCE WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH ROOM. AS WE GOT INTO THE CELL; WE BEGAN GETTING LARGE AIRSPEED FLUCTUATIONS; ONE OF WHICH RESULTED IN THE AIRSPEED DROPPING VERY RAPIDLY TO ABOUT 180 KIAS. AS THE SPEED UNWOUND; THE CAPTAIN CALLED IT AS I WAS ALREADY REACHING FOR THE THRUST LEVERS. I PUSHED THEM UP TO THE DETENT; BUT BY THE TIME THE ENGINES STARTED TO SPOOL; THE PITCH LIMIT INDICATOR CAME DOWN AND THE SHAKER ACTIVATED FOR A BRIEF MOMENT PRIOR TO THE AIRSPEED STARTING TO RECOVER. THE AUTOPILOT DISCONNECTED; AND I PUSHED THE NOSE DOWN SLIGHTLY TO AVOID THE SHAKER/PUSHER AND TO HELP REBUILD AIRSPEED. IT APPEARED TO BE A LARGE DOWNDRAFT THAT CAUSED THE SPEED TO UNWIND THAT QUICKLY. THE SPEED WAS STILL HESITANT TO INCREASE; SO I PUSHED THE THRUST PAST THE DETENT INTO TO-1. ONCE THE SPEED STARTED TO STABILIZE; WE BROUGHT THE NOSE BACK UP TO A LEVEL PITCH AND RECOVERED OUR ALTITUDE. WE WERE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 350 AND 355 WHEN I SAW THE ALTITUDE REVERSE INTO A CLIMB. ATC QUERIED US AND WE NOTIFIED THEM THAT WE LOST ABOUT 500 FEET DUE TO THE TURBULENCE AND WERE RECOVERING BACK TO FL360.THE STICK SHAKER AS A RESULT OF NOT ADEQUATELY REACTING TO THE AIRSPEED LOSS CAUSED A UAS IN THE STICK SHAKER ACTIVATION WITH MODERATE TO SEVERE TURBULENCE.MY EXPERIENCE LEVEL WITH FLYING THROUGH BUILDUPS AT SUCH HIGH ALTITUDES WAS ALSO A FACTOR AS IT TOOK ME A MOMENT LONGER TO PROCESS IT THAN IT SHOULD HAVE; AND THAT RESULTED IN ACTIVATION OF THE STICK SHAKER. I ALSO ALLOWED THE AIRSPEED TO BUILD UP SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN MAY HAVE BEEN NECESSARY DUE TO MY UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT AIRSPEED WAS SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER. I ERRED ON THE SIDE OF BUILDING UP MORE AIRSPEED AS OPPOSED TO LESS.BE MORE CAUTIOUS WITH AIRSPEED DEVIATIONS IN THE EVENT YOU ARE NOT ABLE TO AVOID A TS CELL.,EMB-145LR First Officer reported receiving a stick shaker after inadvertently entering a thunderstorm at FL360.,2015,12
127,201601,ARIZONA,I PILOTED A HOT AIR BALLOON ON A CROSS-COUNTRY FLIGHT AS AN ENTRY IN A COMPETITION. THE FLIGHT WAS PLANNED THE EVENING PRIOR TO THE MORNING LAUNCH; AND ON THE MORNING OF THE FLIGHT; THE WEATHER LOOKED IDEAL FOR THE ATTEMPT. TOP GROUND SPEED ATTAINED WAS 72 MPH AS MEASURED BY GPS DURING THE FLIGHT. MOST OF THE FLIGHT WAS FLOWN NEAR OR BELOW 12;500 FEET MSL WITH AN AVERAGE SPEED ALOFT OF 65 MPH. UPON NEARING THE ZZZ AREA; A DESCENT WAS INITIATED FROM APPROXIMATELY 13;000 FEET IN ORDER TO REMAIN UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR OF THE ZZZ CLASS B AIRSPACE. HOWEVER; THE LIGHTLY LOADED BALLOON (WHICH COULD NOT DESCEND AS QUICKLY AS NORMAL); COUPLED WITH THE HIGH RATE OF SPEED (65 MPH); CAUSED ME TO MISJUDGE THE DESCENT ANGLE; CAUSING THE BALLOON TO OVERSHOOT MY INTENDED TARGET AREA/ALTITUDE BY A FEW MILES.THE BALLOON CONTINUED OVER THE TOP OF THE CLASS B AIRSPACE AT APPROXIMATELY 10;100 FEET MSL AND INTO/THROUGH THE AIRSPACE WHILE DESCENDING FROM 9000 FEET TO 6000 FEET MSL UNTIL APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILES FROM THE WESTERN EDGE. I USED MY HANDHELD AIRCRAFT RADIO TO CONTACT APPROACH BUT RECEIVED NO RESPONSE; LIKELY OWING TO LIMITED TRANSMISSION RANGE. THE GOAL OF THE FLIGHT WAS TO COVER THE FARTHEST DISTANCE; AND THAT MEANT CLIMBING TO AND MAINTAINING A HIGH ALTITUDE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FAST WINDS ALOFT. AT HIGH ALTITUDE; THERE IS REDUCED PERCEPTION OF GROUND SPEED. AS WELL; HOT AIR BALLOONS RARELY FLY AT SPEEDS OF HIGHER THAN 30 MPH. MY RELATIVE INEXPERIENCE WITH SUCH HIGH SPEEDS CAUSED ME TO OVERESTIMATE THE ABILITY OF THE BALLOON TO DESCEND IN TIME TO CLEAR THE CLASS B. THIS AIRSPACE INCURSION WOULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED WITH BETTER SITUATIONAL AWARENESS. BEGINNING THE DESCENT 3 MINUTES SOONER WOULD HAVE KEPT US CLEAR OF CLASS B.,Balloon pilot reported an airspace violation due to unanticipated wind speeds.,2016,01
128,201601,CALIFORNIA,ON DOWNWIND TO LAX FOR 24R AT APPROXIMATELY 5;500 - 5;700 FEET MSL; WE SPOTTED A DRONE AT OUR ALTITUDE IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO OUR AIRCRAFT. I WOULD ESTIMATE THE DRONE WAS ABOUT 100 FEET FROM OUR AIRCRAFT; AND TO MY LEFT. THE DRONE WAS SMALL AND BLACK WITH EITHER WHITE/SILVER/GREY MARKINGS ON IT TO BE MORE VISIBLE. THE DRONE APPEARED TO BE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO US; SO IT WAS GOING WEST; WHILE WE WERE GOING EAST. WE WERE ON AN ASSIGNED HEADING OF 065 DEGREES OUT OF SMO VOR. WE WERE ALSO DESCENDING AT THE TIME. THE FO WAS THE PF AND THE AUTOPILOT WAS ON. THE EVENT OCCURRED AROUND THE JAVSI WAYPOINT; BUT BEFORE THE DOWNTOWN AREA. DUE TO RADIO CONGESTION; I WAS NOT ABLE TO REPORT THE EVENT TO ATC UNTIL WE WERE OVER THE DOWNTOWN AREA AND ABOUT 4;500 MSL. THE DRONE WAS BELOW OUR FIELD OF VISION UNTIL IT WAS BASICALLY PASSING US; SO COLLISION AVOIDANCE HAD IT BEEN ON TRACK TO HIT US; WOULD HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT AT BEST. THE OBJECT ALSO PASSED US AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. WE WERE SPEED ASSIGNED 230 KNOTS IAS AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT. ATC DID AN EXCELLENT JOB NOTIFYING OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA. VISIBILITY WAS SOMEWHAT REDUCED DUE TO HAZE AND SOME SCATTERED CLOUDS AT OUR ALTITUDE; BUT AS MENTIONED; SPOTTING THIS SMALL OF AN OBJECT UNTIL IT IS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY IS DIFFICULT. THERE WAS NO DISRUPTION OF THE FLIGHT AND WE LANDED SAFELY.I REALIZE THIS IS AN ONGOING ISSUE AND I HOPE IT GETS RESOLVED SOON. WHEN I SAW THE OBJECT; I THOUGHT I WAS CRAZY FOR THINKING I SAW ONE OF THESE ABOVE 5;000 FEET. I ACTUALLY DID SOME RESEARCH ONLINE AFTER THIS; AND I'VE READ ABOUT PEOPLE SEEING THESE AS HIGH AS 7;000 FEET. A SYSTEM THAT WORKS WITH OUR TCAS WOULD BE AMAZING TO HAVE IN THE FUTURE. I'M NOT SURE IF THE TECHNOLOGY IS QUITE THERE YET. MAYBE WITH THE UPCOMING ADS-B RULES; THIS COULD BE ON THE TABLE?,Air carrier Captain on downwind vectors for LAX Runway 24R near JAVSI reported a UAV near miss at approximately 5;500 - 5;700 feet.,2016,01
129,201601,CALIFORNIA,LOCATION; DISTANCE; ALTITUDE; SEPARATION AND TIME ARE APPROXIMATE.FLIGHT WAS CONDUCTED IN VMC CONDITIONS; WITH 10+ NM VISIBILITY AND 15;000+ FEET CEILINGS. TIME OF THE OCCURRENCE WAS APPROXIMATELY EARLY AFTERNOON. NO FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED; HOWEVER ATC FLIGHT FOLLOWING/TRANSITION WAS UTILIZED AND REQUESTED WITH LAX AND TORRANCE TOWER'S WHILE TRANSITIONING THROUGH THE LAX BRAVO AIRSPACE AND CONTINUING THROUGH TORRANCE'S CLASS DELTA; SOUTHBOUND ALONG THE SHORELINE NEAR PALOS VERDES ESTATES AT ALTITUDES BETWEEN 100 - 300 FEET MSL. WHILE FLYING SOUTHBOUND ALONG THE COASTLINE OF PALOS VERDES ESTATES; APPROXIMATELY 3 - 3 ½ NM WEST OF TOA AND JUST NORTH OF BLUFF COVE; I ENCOUNTERED/NOTICED AN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (UAS)/DRONE MOVING FROM MY 10 - 9 O'CLOCK HIGH POSITION AT APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET HORIZONTAL AND 150 FEET VERTICALLY ABOVE. UPON NOTICING AND AS A SAFETY PRECAUTION; I ALTERED MY FLIGHT PATH SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT AND CONTINUED UNEVENTFUL.,A helicopter pilot flying the shoreline near TOA at 100 - 300 MSL took evasive action from a UAS flying approximately 100 feet above his altitude.,2016,01
130,201601,COLORADO,AIRCRAFT WAS DESCENDING TO FL300 APPROXIMATELY 30 MILES FROM JAGGR INTERSECTION. ATC ISSUED A FOUR PART CLEARANCE; 'DESCEND VIA THE JAGGR 3 ARRIVAL; EXCEPT MAINTAIN 290 KNOTS UNTIL DANDD; THEN RESUME PUBLISHED SPEEDS; DENVER ALTIMETER --.--'. FIRST OFFICER (FO) AS THE PILOT FLYING BEGAN ADJUSTING THE FMC TO ADJUST THE SPEEDS; WHILE I SET THE BOTTOM ALTITUDE 11;000.  APPARENTLY; THE FMA WAS ALT* VERSUS ALT WHEN THIS HAPPENED; AS THE AIRPLANE CONTINUED DESCENDING VERY SLOWLY TO 29;600.  THE FO IMMEDIATELY CAUGHT THE ERROR (JAGGR IS AT OR ABOVE FL300) AND I REQUESTED AND RECEIVED A CLEARANCE DIRECT CLPTN VOIDING THE NEXT TWO ALTITUDE RESTRICTIONS.  I TAKE COMPLETE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MISTAKE IN HANDLING 4 ISSUES INSTEAD OF VERIFYING THE AIRCRAFT WAS FLYING THE CORRECT ALTITUDE.I OFFER THESE OBSERVATIONS ON THE CURRENT RNAV SID/STAR PROCEDURES:1) THE RNAV PROCEDURES ARE IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH OUR 4 OPERATING PRIORITIES.A) NOT AS SAFE; AS WE ARE SPENDING COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF TIME MAKING SURE OF ALL THE RESTRICTIONS INSTEAD OF FLYING THE PLANE.B) UNCOMFORTABLE FOR OUR PASSENGERS; AS WE SPEED UP AND SLOW DOWN TO MEET THESE TIGHT RESTRICTIONS.C) NOT ALLOWING US TO BE ON TIME; AS WE FLY THESE PUBLISHED SPEEDS WHETHER THERE ARE OTHER PLANES IN THE VICINITY OR WHICH DIRECTION WE ARE LANDING.D) INEFFICIENT; AS WE USE POWER AND SPEED BRAKES TO MEET RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE SIMPLY TOO DEMANDING.2) THE RNAV PROCEDURES FORCE CONSIDERABLE THREATS FROM A CRM/TEM PERSPECTIVE.A) EACH FIX WITH AN ALTITUDE OR SPEED RESTRICTION IS A 'THREAT' TO THE CREW.B) WE COMBAT THE THREAT BY PREPARING FOR IT (VERIFYING EACH RESTRICTION INDEPENDENTLY).C) INEVITABLY; WE 'REPAIR' SOME THREATS BY CHANGING DESCENT MODES; ADDING POWER; OR USING SPEED BRAKES TO GET BACK ON THE PROFILE.D) FINALLY; OCCASIONALLY WE FIND OURSELVES HEADING TOWARD A UAS; AS THIS REPORT POINTS OUT.THE FINAL POINTS TO CONSIDER IN THE DANGER OF THESE PROCEDURES ARE THE 'NEWER' CLEARANCES WE ARE RECEIVING. THE 'MAINTAIN' CLEARANCE.  AS OPPOSED TO THE OLD 'CLIMB AND MAINTAIN' CLEARANCE; WE ARE STARTING TO HEAR 'MAINTAIN' CLEARANCES; WHICH ARE NOT INHERENTLY LOGICAL (HOW CAN I MAINTAIN AN ALTITUDE I'M NOT YET AT?)THE 'CLIMB VIA THE SID' CLEARANCE ISSUED AFTER DEPARTURE; WHICH MAY REQUIRE US TO GO 'HEADS DOWN' TO SEARCH MULTIPLE PAGES OF SID INSTRUCTIONS; TO FIND THE TOP ALTITUDE HIDDEN IN SMALL FONT SOMEWHERE ON THE CHART. PERHAPS EACH SID/STAR SHOULD DISPLAY THE TOP/BOTTOM ALTITUDE ON THE TOP OF THE CHART IN BOLD NUMBERS?THE TRUE SOLUTION MAY COME FROM THE PAST; WHERE FOR EXAMPLE DEN HAD THE 'PROFILE DESCENT'. THIS ALLOWED FOR A CROSSING 35 MILES OUT BETWEEN 17;000 AND 23;000 WHICH ALLOWED ALL AIRCRAFT TYPES TO COMPLY WITH THIS ONE RESTRICTION; THEN DESCEND TO ONE ALTITUDE PRIOR TO ARRIVAL (SAFE; COMFORTABLE; ON TIME; AND EFFICIENT).  ALSO; PLEASE CONSIDER ATC CLEARANCES OF 'CLIMB VIA SID; TOP ALTITUDE XXXXX'; OR 'CLIMB UNRESTRICTED AND MAINTAIN XXXXX'.  SAFETY SHOULD NOT BE A MATTER OF SEMANTICS.,A319 flight crew reported RNAV arrival procedures; using the JAGGR STAR at DEN as an example; are increasing workload and asserted they are 'not as safe' as previous descent procedures.,2016,01
131,201601,FLORIDA,REPORTING PILOT WAS LEADER OF A FLIGHT OF FOUR WARBIRDS ON A FORMATION PROFICIENCY MISSION. ALL AIRCRAFT WERE RECEIVING AND TRANSMITTING ON A FORMATION COMMON FREQUENCY AND ALL AIRCRAFT WERE BRIEFED TO FOLLOW AND MONITOR ATC FREQUENCIES ON THEIR SECOND RADIO. COMPLETED PRE-TAKEOFF CHECKS AND CALLED FOR TAKEOFF CLEARANCE ON THE GROUND FREQUENCY BY MISTAKE. GROUND RESPONDED AND ADVISED ME TO SWITCH TO TOWER FREQUENCY. I MISUNDERSTOOD THIS AS CLEARANCE TO TAXI ON TO THE RUNWAY WHICH I DID WHILE SWITCHING TO TOWER FREQUENCY. TOWER DID NOT NOTICE THE FLIGHT MOVEMENT UNTIL THE ENTIRE FLIGHT OF FOUR WERE LINED UP ON THE RUNWAY AND NO FLIGHT MEMBER REALIZED THE MISTAKE OR TRANSMITTED TO ME TO HOLD SHORT. THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC CONFLICT AND; AFTER A BRIEF EXCHANGE BETWEEN TOWER AND ME; THE TOWER CLEARED THE FLIGHT FOR TAKEOFF.THE MISTAKE WAS ENTIRELY WITH ME AS FLIGHT LEADER. NEITHER OF THE TWO POTENTIAL 'FAIL-SAFES' PREVENTED THIS INCIDENT. 1.) MY FLIGHT TEAM SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THE LACK OF CLEARANCE AND TRANSMITTED FOR ME TO HOLD SHORT. 2.) THE TOWER COULD HAVE SEEN THE MOVEMENT AND TRANSMITTED FOR ME TO HOLD SHORT.THE MISTAKE OCCURRED BECAUSE OF LEAD PILOT OVERLOAD AND CONFUSION IN MANAGING THE PRE-TAKEOFF OPERATIONS OF A FLIGHT OF FOUR AIRCRAFT. IN THE FUTURE I WILL TAKE MORE TIME AND BE ABSOLUTELY SURE OF RADIO CLEARANCES FROM ATC. I WILL ALSO BRIEF AND EXECUTE MANDATED RADIO FREQUENCY CHANGES ON BOTH PRIMARY AND SECONDARY RADIO FREQUENCIES. I WILL ALSO RE-BRIEF THE WINGMEN RESPONSIBILITIES FOR SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND INTERVENTION ON THE RADIO WHEN AN UNSAFE CONDITION EXISTS.,Lead pilot in a flight of four reported a runway incursion when none of the four recognized they were not actually cleared into position.,2016,01
132,201601,FLORIDA,WHILE TURNING BASE TO FINAL INSIDE OF ZISUR FOR A VISUAL APPROACH TO 10L WE HAD A DRONE ENCOUNTER. WE WERE IN A DESCENDING LEFT TURN AT APPROXIMATELY 1800 FT. DRONE PASSED JUST UNDER OUR LEFT WING. CONTROLLERS WERE NOTIFIED. A SHERIFF DEPARTMENT HELICOPTER WAS IN THE AIR AND IMMEDIATELY WENT TO THE AREA; BUT DID NOT FIND THE DRONE.IT WAS A BLACK QUADCOPTER OF THE RECREATIONAL VARIETY. IT WAS NOT A COMMERCIAL TYPE (NO LARGE CAMERA). APPARENTLY THERE WAS SOME TYPE OF LOCAL FAIR GOING ON; AND THEY THOUGHT IT MAY HAVE COME FROM THERE. TOWER REQUESTED I CALL. I COULDN'T ADD MUCH MORE THAN WE TOLD THEM DURING THE ENCOUNTER.,Fractional Jet flight crew experienced a close encounter with a drone while on initial approach.,2016,01
133,201601,FLORIDA,ON APPROACH TO MIA RUNWAY 9; AT APPROXIMATELY 500 AGL; I SAW A DRONE PASS OUR FLIGHT PATH. I POINTED IT OUT TO THE CAPTAIN; FLYING PILOT. NO AVOIDANCE MANEUVERS WERE NECESSARY. THE DRONE; BLACK AND WHITE IN COLOR AND A QUADCOPTER DESIGN; PASSED FROM SOUTH TO NORTH.,B737-800 flight crew reported a NMAC with a drone at 500 feet AGL during approach to MIA Runway 9. The quadcopter was pointed out to the flying Captain; but no evasive action was required.,2016,01
134,201601,FLORIDA,ON TAKEOFF ROLL; JUST PRIOR TO V1; [I] OBSERVED A BIRD OF PREY; WITH SOMETHING IN ITS TALONS; LIFTING OFF FROM THE CENTERLINE OF THE RUNWAY. AS THE BIRD PASSED CLOSE ABROAD THE RIGHT SIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT; WE HEARD A LOAD BANG. [I] INITIATED A REJECTED TAKEOFF AS THE F/O WAS CALLING 'V1'. AFTER AIRCRAFT WAS STOPPED; F/O INFORMED TAMPA TOWER OF OUR REJECT. [I] MADE A PA AND TOLD THE PASSENGERS TO REMAIN SEATED. WE DECIDED WE DID NOT NEED TO RUN ANY EMERGENCY CHECKLIST. WE DISCUSSED BRAKE COOLING AND DECIDED WE COULD TAXI TO THE GATE FOR THE REQUIRED BRAKE COOLING (40 MINUTES PER THE PERFORMANCE COMPUTER BRAKE COOLING MODULE). WE DISCUSSED THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE BIRD WAS INGESTED BY THE NUMBER TWO ENGINE AND ELECTED TO SHUT IT DOWN AS WE TAXIED. REMAINDER OF TAXI TO THE GATE WAS UNEVENTFUL.,B737 flight crew reported rejecting the takeoff after experiencing a bird strike just below V1.,2016,01
135,201601,NEW YORK,WE WERE ASSIGNED 17;000. ATC GAVE US A CLIMB TO FL180; WHICH WE INITIATED. AS WE BEGAN TO LEVEL AT THE TRANSITION ALTITUDE; ATC QUESTIONED OUR ALTITUDE. AT THIS POINT WE WERE LEVELING AND WE WENT TO STANDARD. THE ALTITUDE BALLOONED TO AROUND 18;200 DUE TO THE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE. THE CALL FROM ATC WAS CONFUSING AT FIRST; BUT WE IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED WHEN WE REALIZED THE PROBLEM.THE BOOK SAYS THE MOVE TO STANDARD SHOULD BE DONE CLIMBING THROUGH THE TRANSITION ALTITUDE AND IT STATES (18;000); IF THE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE IS GREAT BY THE TIME YOU REACH 18;000 YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY DEVIATED FROM THE ASSIGNED ALTITUDE. IN THE FUTURE I THINK I WOULD GO TO STANDARD A LITTLE EARLIER PERHAPS 17;500 AND BE MINDFUL OF THE BAROMETRIC CHANGE.,EMB170 First Officer reported being level at 17;000 feet then assigned FL180 by ATC. The altimeter is not reset to 29.92 until reaching 18000 feet resulting is a 200 foot overshoot.,2016,01
136,201601,NORTH CAROLINA,AS AIRCRAFT X WAS CLIMBING THROUGH 6;500 FEET ON DEPARTURE; THE PILOT REPORTED A DRONE ABOUT 2;000 FEET BELOW THE AIRCRAFT. NOT SURE WHAT THE FAA CAN DO ABOUT THIS PROBLEM.,CLT TRACON Controller was informed by a flight crew that a drone passed about 2;000 feet below the aircraft as they were climbing through 6;500 feet.,2016,01
137,201601,TEXAS,IN NACOGDOCHES COUNTY TEXAS; I WAS MISTAKENLY PILOTING AN UAV IN CLASS G AIR SPACE. I WAS FLYING AT APPROXIMATELY 350 FT AGL TAKING PHOTOGRAPHY OF THE SUNSET OFF THE TREETOPS. I NOTICED AN AIRSTRIP IN THE DISTANCE AND IMMEDIATELY GROUNDED THE AIRCRAFT. I RESEARCHED MY LOCATION AND REALIZED I AM WITHIN 5 MILES OF MANGHAM JR. REGIONAL AIRPORT IN NACOGDOCHES; TX. I ASSUMED ANGELINA COUNTY AIRPORT WAS THE ONLY AIRPORT IN THE AREA. I WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH LOCAL AIRSPACE WITH SECTIONAL CHARTS PRIOR TO FLYING. I WILL ALSO MAKE CONTACT WITH ATC IN CONTROLLED AIRSPACE PRIOR TO FLYING.,DJI Phantom 3 UAS pilot flying at sunset discovered he launched near an airport when he viewed the airport through his UAS video camera.,2016,01
138,201601,UTAH,AFTER HAND-OFF FROM CENTER TO APPROACH; I HEARD THE TAIL-END OF AN EVENT WARNING FROM APPROACH CONTROL REGARDING OUR PREFERRED RUNWAY - 34R. AT CHECK IN WITH APPROACH I ASKED WHAT THE EVENT AT APPROACH END 300 MSL WAS; AND THE CONTROLLER DID NOT ANSWER ME; INSTEAD GIVING INSTRUCTIONS - ASSIGNMENT TO A DIFFERENT RUNWAY THAN EXPECTED (34L); AND A HEADING OF 010 TO INTERCEPT THE LOCALIZER. I READ THE CLEARANCE BACK; THEN I QUERIED CONTROLLER TWO MORE TIMES ABOUT THE ISSUE WITH 34R BEFORE CONTROLLER RESPONDED TO ME - THE EVENT WAS UNAUTHORIZED DRONE ACTIVITY ON THE APPROACH PATH. SHORTLY THEREAFTER I WAS LOOKING AT THE CDI AND THINKING THE VECTOR TO JOIN WAS NOT VERY GOOD. THEN APPROACH CALLED AND ASKED IF WE WERE OFF OF THE ARRIVAL. I RESPONDED THAT WE WERE FLYING THE ASSIGNED HEADING TO JOIN THE LOCALIZER; AND CONTROLLER SAID THAT OUR CLEARANCE WAS PRESENT HEADING TO JOIN. AT THAT POINT CONTROLLER GAVE US HEADING 020 TO JOIN; WHICH WAS A MORE EFFECTIVE VECTOR. THE APPROACH TO LANDING PROCEEDED NORMALLY FROM THAT POINT; ALTHOUGH THE POSITION OF THE DRONE REPORTS CHANGED SOMEWHAT. THERE WERE NO TERRAIN OR TRAFFIC SEPARATION ISSUES.THE SUDDEN REPORT OF THE DRONE SEEMS TO HAVE THROWN EVERYONE'S GAME OFF JUST A BIT. I ONLY HEARD A FRAGMENT OF THE REPORT; AND IN GOOD WEATHER CONDITIONS I WAS WONDERING WHAT THE WARNING COULD BE ABOUT. THE SUDDEN CHANGE ALSO CHANGED THE WORKLOAD FOR THE CONTROLLER. I AM PRETTY SURE I HEARD 010 HEADING; I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS A CONTROLLER ERROR OR HEAR BACK/READ BACK ERROR. I DID MAKE A MISTAKE BY COMBINING MY QUERY WITH THE CHECK IN CALL - I SHOULD HAVE MADE THAT TWO SEPARATE COMMUNICATIONS. OR I ALSO COULD HAVE WAITED TO HEAR THE REPORT AGAIN; AS WE WERE MORE THAN 20 MILES FROM THE AIRPORT AND THERE WAS REALLY NO TIME PRESSURE (OTHER THAN GETTING OUR PREFERRED RUNWAY TO END THE DAY).IF MY READ BACK WAS IN ERROR; THE CONTROLLER DID NOT CORRECT ME FROM 'HEADING 010' TO 'PRESENT HEADING'.,A UAV presence at 300 feet on the final approach to SLC parallel runway overloaded the TRACON and disrupted communications with arriving flight crews. All associated personnel experienced workload increases.,2016,01
139,201602,DC,WHILE ON THE CAPSS2 ARRIVAL TO DCA; LEVEL AT 3;000 FT WAS BEING VECTORED HEADING 050 AND REPORT RIVER INSIGHT. AFTER REPORTING THE RIVER IN SIGHT WAS VECTORED TO TURN RIGHT HEADING 150; DESCEND TO 2;500 SLOW TO 170 KTS AND CLEARED FOR THE RIVER VISUAL 19. DURING THE DESCENT A DRONE FLEW DIRECTLY OVERHEAD ON A SOUTH HEADING LESS THAN 150-200 [FT] OVERHEAD. THE DRONE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE A MILITARY UAV. NO EVASIVE MANEUVERS WERE INITIATED. THE SUBSEQUENT APPROACH AND LANDING WERE UNEVENTFUL. THE INCIDENT WAS REPORTED TO THE DCA TOWER CONTROLLER AND AFTER LANDING WAS INSTRUCTED TO CALL THE TOWER CHIEF. I REPORTED THE DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT OVER THE PHONE.,CRJ700 Captain reported a NMAC with a drone while descending to 2500 ft on the DCA River Visual Runway 19.,2016,02
140,201602,ILLINOIS,APPROX 2 HOURS INTO OUR FLIGHT (TIME AND POSITION WERE NOT NOTED); WE WERE ADVISED BY ATC THAT AN EXPERIMENTAL BALLOON WAS IN FREE FALL NEAR OUR POSITION. WE WERE ALSO ADVISED THAT THE VEHICLE WAS UNLIT AND HAD NO TRANSPONDER AND NO WAY TO FIX ITS POSITION. ATC LATER REPORTED THAT THEY HAD A PRIMARY TARGET AT OUR NINE THIRTY POSITION AND EIGHT MILES AND ESTIMATED THE ALTITUDE AT 45;000; BUT COULD NOT CONFIRM THAT IT WAS THE PLUMMETING BALLOON. ALTHOUGH WE WERE LOOKING FOR ANY TRACE OF THE BALLOON; WE DID NOT SEE; NOR WOULD WE LIKELY SEE IT; DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS UNLIT AND IT WAS A DARK NIGHTWE CONTINUED TO OUR DESTINATION WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.WHY THE BALLOON FAILED IS UNKNOWN. HOWEVER; THE FACT THAT IT DID NOT HAVE EMERGENCY LIGHTS AND EMERGENCY TRANSPONDER (OR OTHER WAY TO ABSOLUTELY FIX IT'S POSITION) WHEN OPERATING ABOVE COMMERCIAL AIR ROUTES IS INEXCUSABLE. IT WOULD SEEM A SIMPLE THING TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY ANEROID SWITCH THAT WOULD ACTIVATE WHEN BELOW A CERTAIN ALTITUDE; SAY 80;000 FT; THUS GIVING POSITION/ALTITUDE DATA; AS WELL LIGHTING FOR VISUAL CONFORMATION (SEE AND AVOID) DURING HOURS OF DARKNESS.,ATC notified an air carrier at FL360 about an experimental balloon in a free fall descent through an estimated FL450; unlit and without a transponder during night conditions.,2016,02
141,201603,CALIFORNIA,WE WERE BEING VECTORED TO THE ILS RUNWAY 8 AT BURBANK (BUR) JUST OUTSIDE OF BUDDE INTERSECTION AT 3;000 FEET WHEN THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT (WHO WAS SITTING IN THE JUMP SEAT) DESCRIBED WHAT SHE BELIEVES WAS A DRONE FLY PAST US. THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT ESTIMATED THE OBJECT WAS AT OUR EXACT ALTITUDE AND ABOUT HALF A WINGSPAN OFF TO THE LEFT OF OUR AIRCRAFT.NEITHER THE CAPTAIN NOR I EVER SAW IT. WE CONTINUED FOR AN UNEVENTFUL LANDING ON RUNWAY 8.,GIV First Officer is informed by the Flight Attendant in the jumpseat that they had just missed a drone at 3000 feet during vectors to Runway 8 at BUR. The flight crew never saw the UAV and no evasive action was taken.,2016,03
142,201603,NEW JERSEY,AIRCRAFT X WAS CLEARED FOR THE ILS RWY 19 APPROACH BY NY TRACON (MUGZY). HE WAS CHANGED TO MY FREQUENCY (TEB TOWER; 119.5). UPON INITIAL CONTACT; THE COLLISION ALERT ALARM ALERTED ME OF A VFR TARGET APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES SOUTH OF AIRCRAFT X'S POSITION; TRANSITIONING IN BLOCK OF AIRSPACE THAT CUTS DIRECTLY THROUGH THE FINAL FOR THE ILS TO RWY 19. TRAFFIC WAS ISSUED TO THE ONLY AIRCRAFT I HAD ON FREQUENCY (AIRCRAFT X) AND HE WAS INSTRUCTED TO 'DESCEND IF NECESSARY' TO AVOID A COLLISION. AIRCRAFT X PICKED UP THE TRAFFIC AT APPROXIMATELY ONE HALF MILE OF HORIZONTAL SEPARATION WITH ONLY 100 FEET OF VERTICAL SEPARATION. AIRCRAFT X WAS INSTRUCTED TO DESCEND IMMEDIATELY TO AVOID TRAFFIC. AT THE SAME TIME; THE UNIDENTIFIED VFR TARGET (LATER IDENTIFIED AS AIRCRAFT Y BY THE AIRCRAFT X PILOT) ALSO BEGAN TO DESCEND; PUTTING BOTH AIRCRAFT AT THE SAME ALTITUDES AS TARGETS MERGED AT 6 MILE FINAL FOR RUNWAY 19. AIRCRAFT X PASSED BEHIND AIRCRAFT Y AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. AIRCRAFT Y LATER PICKED UP FLIGHT FOLLOWING WITH N90 (HAARP/LGA SECTOR) AND HIS TAILNUMBER WAS IDENTIFIED AS AIRCRAFT Y. AS THE PILOT TECHNICALLY DIDN'T VIOLATE ANY AIRSPACE; HIS TAILNUMBER AND TYPE WERE ONLY RECORDED FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS SAFETY REPORT.THE AIRSPACE TO THE NORTH OF TETERBORO IS AN UNCONTROLLED VFR CORRIDOR THAT ALLOWS AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTERS TO TRANSITION 5 MILES NORTH OF THE AIRPORT WITHOUT ANY RADIO COMMUNICATION WITH TETERBORO TOWER OR NY TRACON (N90). THIS INCIDENT IS ONE OF MANY THAT CLEARLY ILLUSTRATE THE NEED FOR THAT AIRSPACE TO BE CONTROLLED BY EITHER FACILITY; AS IT IS A BUSY TRANSITION AREA FOR AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTERS ENROUTE TO THE HUDSON RIVER. TETERBORO VERY EASILY COULD BE GRANTED A RADAR ASSIST POSITION AND GIVEN THE AIRSPACE TO THE NORTH OF THE AIRPORT TO PROPERLY CONTROL THE VFR TRAFFIC ALTITUDES AS IT PASSES THROUGH THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE FOR RUNWAY 19. CONTINUING TO LET THIS AREA OF AIRSPACE BE UNCONTROLLED IS DANGEROUS.,TEB Tower Controller reported of a NMAC between an aircraft under ATC control and a VFR aircraft. Reporter stated this is in the vicinity of an uncontrolled VFR corridor and is a very busy transition area. Reporter would like someone to control this area to help avoid conflicts.,2016,03
143,201603,OHIO,I WAS PILOT FLYING A VISUAL APPROACH INTO CMH RUNWAY 10R. AT ABOUT 500 FEET AGL; FO KEYED MIC AND TOLD TOWER THERE WAS A DRONE UNDERNEATH OUR AIRCRAFT AT ABOUT 200 FEET AND THERE WAS NO CONFLICT. WE LANDED UNEVENTFULLY. I NEVER SAW THE DRONE.,B737-800 Captain reported his First Officer spotted a drone operating about 300 feet below them; at approximately 200 feet AGL; while on visual approach to CMH Runway 10R.,2016,03
144,201603,OHIO,AS PM; I NOTICED FAST MOVING LED'S APPROXIMATELY HALF MILE AHEAD OF US AND 200 TO 300 FEET BELOW US ON SHORT FINAL TO RUNWAY 10R AT CMH. IT APPEARED TO BE A DRONE OF SOME SORT; SO I NOTIFIED TOWER AND HE IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED THAT HE HAD EYES ON IT JUST AS I FINISHED POINTING OUT THE 'TRAFFIC'. THE PF KEPT FLYING A GREAT VISUAL APPROACH AND LANDED UNEVENTFULLY. TOWER NOTIFIED A POLICE HELICOPTER IN THE AIR NEARBY AND THEY HAD HIM SPOTLIGHTED BEFORE WE EVEN GOT TO THE GATE (A ONE MINUTE TAXI; ALMOST FROM 10R).,Air carrier First Officer reported a near miss with a UAV while on short final to CMH Runway 10R.,2016,03
145,201603,TEXAS,WHILE CONDUCTING A ROUTINE AERIAL MISSION IN THE VICINITY OF THE MCALLEN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT A NEAR MISS OCCURRED WITH A SUSPECTED PRIVATELY OWNED DRONE AIRCRAFT. WHILE PERFORMING LOW LEVEL HELICOPTER OPERATIONS; THE NON-FLYING CREWMEMBER SAW AN OBJECT AT THE SAME THE ALTITUDE AS OUR AIRCRAFT. THE PILOT BANKED THE AIRCRAFT TO THE LEFT TO AVOID THE OBJECT. AS THE OBJECT PASSED OFF TO THE RIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT; WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 100FT OF THE AIRCRAFT; IT WAS OBSERVED THAT IT WAS QUADCOPTER DRONE TYPE AIRCRAFT. DRONE IS SUSPECTED OF BEING FLOWN BY AN ON DUTY [GOVERNMENT] AGENT; WHO WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO CONDUCT AERIAL SURVEILLANCE OPERATIONS. NO FURTHER ACTIONS WERE NECESSARY AND THE AIRCREW CONTINUED MISSION WITHOUT INCIDENT.,Helicopter crew experienced a near miss with a drone which required evasive action.,2016,03
146,201603,UTAH,I HAD JUST ENTERED PVU CLASS DELTA AIRSPACE. I WAS 6000 FEET MSL DESCENDING TO 5500 MSL. I OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN UNMANNED DRONE AIRCRAFT AT 1000 AGL (5500 MSL). THE OBSERVATION WAS REPORTED TO THE CONTROL TOWER.,DA20 Instructor reported sighting a drone in PVU Class D airspace and reported it to the Tower.,2016,03
147,201603,UTAH,WE HAD A NORMAL PUSH THEN THE AFTER START FLOW ONTO THE BEFORE TAXI CHECKLIST. I VIVIDLY REMEMBER WAITING FOR THE LEADING EDGE TRANSIT LIGHT TO EXTINGUISH BEFORE THE CAPTAIN CALLED FOR THE BEFORE TAXI CHECKLIST.  WE TAXIED TO THE RUNWAY UNEVENTFULLY; WE DID GET RUSHED ON THE BEFORE TAKEOFF CHECKLIST AS WE WAITED AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF TIME FOR THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS TO COMPLETE THEIR ANNOUNCEMENT WHILE WE HAD BEEN CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF. TAKEOFF ROLL WAS UNEVENTFUL BUT UNUSUALLY BUMPY. I REMEMBER HOLDING ONTO THE GLARE SHIELD AT ONE POINT TO STOP THE VIBRATION. AFTER A NORMAL ROTATION; I NOTICED A FLOCK OF BIRDS APPROACHING. I LEANED FORWARD AND MAY HAVE QUICKLY PROPPED MYSELF UP USING THE FLAP LEVER FOR A BETTER VIEW OF WHAT MIGHT BE AN IMPENDING BIRD STRIKE; IT ENDED UP BEING A NON-EVENT. I THEN NOTICED A BUFFER MESSAGE ON THE FMC AS WELL AS AIRSPEED WARNING ON THE PRIMARY FLIGHT DISPLAY (PFD). I SIMULTANEOUSLY PUSHED THE POWER UP WHILE TELLING THE CAPTAIN; 'YOU BETTER PUSH IT OVER A LITTLE; SOMETHING ISN'T RIGHT.' HE DID EXACTLY THAT; WHILE MY EYES CAUGHT THE FLAP GAUGE AT ZERO. I SELECTED FLAPS 1 IMMEDIATELY AND THE WARNINGS WENT AWAY AS WE CLIMBED OUT NORMALLY. WE NEVER RECEIVED A SHAKER OR PUSHER. THE FLIGHT CONTINUED NORMALLY.AS YOU CAN IMAGINE; WE WERE BEWILDERED WITH THE SITUATION. WE INITIALLY THOUGHT WE HAD FORGOTTEN TO SET THE FLAPS. I THEN REMINDED HIM THAT THE THROTTLE BURSTS AND TAKEOFF CONFIGURATION WARNING GAVE US NO INDICATION OF THAT. WE TESTED THE TAKEOFF CONFIGURATION WARNING SYSTEM UPON LANDING...IT WAS NORMAL. I ASSUME A MECHANICAL/ELECTRICAL ERROR WAS NOT TO BLAME.,A B737 flight crew became distracted by a bird flock during takeoff roll. The flap handle may have been used to prop up the First Officer for better view resulting in movement of handle to flaps up.,2016,03
148,201604,CALIFORNIA,I WAS HANDED PAPERWORK FROM MY SUPERVISOR WHILE ON POSITION. THE PAPERWORK PROVIDED A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF WHAT TO EXPECT FROM A FLIGHT THAT WAS TO FLY THROUGH MY AIRSPACE (AIRCRAFT X). THE PAPERWORK SAID AIRCRAFT X WOULD ORBIT IN NTTR FOR 2+00 HRS. WHEN THE AIRCRAFT CHECKED ON; HE ASKED TO PROCEED TO KL45M AND HOLD FOR TWO HOURS. I SAID PROCEED AS REQUESTED BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT WAS A PART OF THE PRE-COORDINATED ROUTE THAT HAD BEEN ESTABLISHED. ONCE I REALIZED HE WAS TURNING TOWARDS THE RESTRICTED AIRSPACE I CALLED AND ASKED NELLIS IF AIRCRAFT X COULD IN FACT COME IN AND HOLD AS HE REQUESTED. THEY SAID UNABLE AND HE HAD TO STAY OUT OF THE AIRSPACE. FROM THAT POINT; I GOT BUSY AT THE SECTOR AND WAS TRYING TO GET ANSWERS FROM MANAGEMENT AS TO WHAT I NEEDED TO DO WITH THIS AIRCRAFT SINCE HE WAS NOT ALLOWED INTO THE RESTRICTED AIRSPACE LIKE WE HAD PLANNED. I PUT AIRCRAFT X ON A HEADING TO STALL AND TRY TO FIND ANSWERS. WHEN I TRIED TO ISSUE HIM HOLDING INSTRUCTIONS HE INFORMED ME THAT HE IS UNABLE TO ACCEPT 'FAA HOLDING INSTRUCTIONS' AND WAS JUST REQUESTING A 'DELAY.' I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ISSUING A 'DELAY' DOES AND HOW I CAN POSSIBLY ENSURE SEPARATION OR ENSURE I KNOW WHAT THE AIRCRAFT IS DOING IF I SIMPLY TELL HIM TO DELAY AS REQUESTED. I WAS THEN HANDED PAPERWORK ON AN AREA OF AIRSPACE AND INSTRUCTED TO ASK THE AIRCRAFT X PILOT IF HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH 'THE OPS AREA NORTHEAST OF LAS.' THE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT FAMILIAR. THE WHOLE THING WAS A CLUSTER AND I WAS BUSY WITH OTHER AIRPLANES AND NORMAL COMPLEXITY OF AN ALREADY BUSY SECTOR. I FELT LIKE MY ENTIRE AREA HAD NO IDEA HOW TO HANDLE THE SITUATION; INCLUDING THE MOS (MILITARY OPERATIONS SPECIALIST) WHO HAD BEEN CALLED DOWN TO HELP ME OR TRY TO PROVIDE ANSWERS. AIRCRAFT X ENDED UP JUST FLYING IN CIRCLES IN MY SECTOR WITH NO REAL 'HOLDING' INSTRUCTIONS ESTABLISHED BECAUSE HE COULDN'T ACCEPT THEM. THERE WAS NO INCIDENT BUT IT WAS A SAFETY ISSUE BECAUSE THE LEVEL OF DISTRACTION THAT THIS ONE OPERATION CAUSED ME PUT MY SECTOR IN AN UNSAFE SITUATION.THESE DRONE OPERATIONS NEED TO BE MORE CLEARLY DEFINED AND THE PILOTS NEED TO BE MADE AWARE OF THE REQUIREMENTS. THEY CAN'T JUST EXPECT TO GET TO HOLD AND NOT BE ABLE TO ACCEPT HOLDING INSTRUCTIONS. I'M NOT SURE WHAT WENT WRONG; BECAUSE I'M NOT THE MOS AND NOT FAMILIAR ENOUGH WITH THE DRONE OPERATIONS TO RECOMMEND A GOOD SOLUTION. I JUST WANT TO MAKE ATSAP AWARE OF THE DISTRACTION THIS CAUSED MYSELF WHILE WORKING A BUSY SECTOR; AND THE DISTRACTION IT CAUSED MY ENTIRE AREA.,ZLA controllers reported a UAV that could not accept holding instructions and was not allowed in restricted airspace. One Controller was confused and had busy airspace. The MOS did not have any special instructions to help and the UAV made circles until a resolution was found.,2016,04
149,201604,CALIFORNIA,I ISSUED AIRCRAFT X A CLEARANCE FOR THE ILS APPROACH. AS AIRCRAFT X WAS DESCENDING ON THE EMZOH3 ARRIVAL I OBSERVED AN UNIDENTIFIED VFR AIRCRAFT 12 MILES WEST LEVEL AT 4000 FEET IN THE FLIGHT PATH OF AIRCRAFT X.  I CANCELLED AIRCRAFT X APPROACH CLEARANCES AND ASSIGNED 5500 FEET TO PASS ABOVE THE VFR TRAFFIC.  THE UNIDENTIFIED VFR AIRCRAFT PROCEEDED TO CLIMB AT A QUICK RATE WHICH THEN CAUSED AIRCRAFT X TO RESPOND TO AN RA TO DESCEND.ON THIS SECTOR WE ARE NOT PROTECTED BY THE CLASS B WHICH CAUSES NUMEROUS VFR AIRCRAFT TO TRANSITION THROUGH THE FINALS OF THE AIRPORT.  WE CAN ASSUME AT TIMES THE PATH AND ALTITUDE THE UNIDENTIFIED VFR AIRCRAFT TAKE; BUT USUALLY IT'S DIFFICULT TO PLAN ON WHAT ACTION TO TAKE TO AVOID THESE AIRCRAFT. AN EXTENDED CLASS C OR A LOWER CLASS B MAY PROVE BENEFICIAL.,NCT Controller reported assigning an air carrier an altitude to stay above unidentified VFR traffic. The VFR traffic climbed toward the air carrier which responded to a TCAS RA alert.,2016,04
150,201604,CALIFORNIA,WHILE ON FINAL APPROXIMATELY 1;600 FEET MSL/4.0 NM FROM THE AIRPORT; I POINTED OUT WHAT AT FIRST APPEARED TO BE A BLACK BALLOON RAPIDLY CLIMBING AND APPROACHING US. THE OBJECT FLEW ABOVE US; SO NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS REQUIRED. AS WE GOT CLOSER TO THE OBJECT; I REALIZED IT WAS NOT A BALLOON; BUT A LARGE SIZED; BLACK IN COLOR; REMOTE CONTROLLED DRONE. I COULD SEE THE ANGULAR SHAPE OF THE FRAME. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET ABOVE US ON FINAL. WE WERE ON THE VISUAL APPROACH; USING THE RNAV APPROACH FOR GUIDANCE. WE REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO TOWER; AND WHEN ON THE GROUND; CLARIFIED THE POSITION WITH GROUND CONTROL TO PASS IT ALONG TO OTHER AIRCRAFT. AS WITH LASERS; DRONES NEED TO BE REGULATED STRICTLY; SWIFTLY AND QUICKLY. UNFORTUNATELY; IT WILL TAKE A FATAL ACCIDENT TO CHANGE THE VIEW OF HOW DEADLY DRONES CAN BE TO ANY AIRCRAFT; ESPECIALLY PASSENGER CARRYING AIRCRAFT. IT IS CLEAR TO ME THAT CURRENT REGULATIONS IN PLACE ARE NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM FLYING DRONES. SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE BEFORE THERE IS A LOSS OF LIFE.,EMB-175 Captain reported a close UAS encounter at 1;600 feet on a four mile final to Runway 27 at SAN.,2016,04
151,201604,CALIFORNIA,ON SHORT FINAL TO RWY 30 AT WHP I HAD A NEAR-MISS WITH A DRONE TRAVELING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION; DIRECTLY ON RWY CENTERLINE AND GLIDE PATH. DRONE WAS MULTI-ROTOR; BLACK; WITH A HEADLIGHT. DID NOT HAVE TIME FOR EVASIVE ACTION AND EVASIVE ACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN LIMITED DUE TO LOW AGL ALTITUDE AND LOW AIRSPEED. REPORTED IT TO TOWER.,A single engine aircraft pilot on short final to WHP Runway 30 reported a near miss with a UAV.,2016,04
152,201604,IDAHO,AIRCRAFT X; A VFR AIRCRAFT INBOUND FROM THE SOUTH; WAS INFORMED OF THE LOCAL UAS FIELD THAT IS LOCATED 3 MILES SOUTH OF THE TWIN FALLS AIRPORT. THE UAS FIELD WAS OPERATIONAL AT OR BELOW 800 AGL. AIRCRAFT X WAS LEVEL AT 5500 WHEN HE REPORTED A REMOTE CONTROLLED AIRCRAFT THAT HE ESTIMATED TO BE 200 FEET ABOVE HIS ALTITUDE AND ABOUT 3/4 TO 1 MILE NORTH TO HIS LOCATION. THE PILOT OF THE UAS WAS CONTACTED AND TOLD OF THE ERROR. IN ADDITION THIS IS THE SECOND TIME; WITHIN A WEEK THAT THE UAS OPERATORS HAVE BEEN TOO HIGH. TWIN FALLS IS A LOCATION WITH LOTS OF LAND AND OPEN SPACES; I RECOMMEND THAT THE UAS FIELD BE RELOCATED TO A DIFFERENT AREA THAT IS NOT WITHIN TWF CLASS DELTA AIRSPACE. IN MY OPINION; IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE WE HAVE AN ACCIDENT DUE TO OPERATION OF REMOTE CONTROL AIRCRAFT WITHIN CONTROLLED AIRSPACE. I HAVE SPOKEN TO UAS OPERATORS AND THEY DON'T HAVE ACCURATE EQUIPMENT THAT DISPLAYS ALTITUDE INFORMATION IN REAL TIME. TO MY UNDERSTANDING THEY CAN ATTACH EQUIPMENT THAT WILL TELL THEM WHAT ALTITUDE THEY FLEW AT; HOWEVER; THAT IS ONLY AFTER THEY HAVE LANDED. THE UAS WITHIN CLASS DELTA AIRSPACE INTRODUCES UNNECESSARY RISK INTO THE NAS. PLEASE LOOK INTO THIS ISSUE.,TWF Tower Controller reported of a pilot that reported a UAV was 200 feet above the pilot's aircraft at 5500 feet MSL. Controller reported there is a UAS field 3 miles south of the airport and this was the second time this has happened.,2016,04
153,201604,ILLINOIS,TWO AND A HALF MILES EAST OF A OLCYK ON THE PANGG ARRIVAL; WE HAD A DRONE PASS AT 200 FEET ABOVE US AND 500-1000 FEET LATERAL. WE REPORTED DRONE TO ATC. WE DID NOT NEED TO TAKE ANY EVASIVE MANEUVERS.,B737 Captain reported a drone encounter near OLCYK on the PANGG3 Arrival to MDW.,2016,04
154,201604,MARYLAND,DRONE SIGHTING REPORT. WHILE FLYING A CIRRUS SR20 AT 1150 FT WESTBOUND ENROUTE TO FME IVO RIISE WAYPOINT; APPROXIMATELY 2 MILES SSE OF WMPT TV TOWER (1049 FT ON SECTIONAL); 7 MILES WEST OF ANNAPOLIS; MD; AT 120 KTS; SPOTTED A LARGE (APPROXIMATELY 2-3 FT DIAMETER) BLACK AND RED UAS FLYING APPROXIMATELY WESTBOUND; SAME DIRECTION OF TRAVEL (ESTIMATED DUE TO SLOW CLOSURE RATE AND DURATION OF SIGHTING; APPROXIMATELY 20 SEC); AT ALTITUDE OF BETWEEN 1000-1100 FT. IT APPEARED AT FIRST AS A FAR OFF HELICOPTER AT LOWER ALTITUDE; THOUGH NOT ON TIS-B MFDS (ADS-B OUT/MODE-S IN). AS WE GREW CLOSER IT WAS APPARENT IT WAS A DRONE; WHICH WE OVER TOOK WITHIN 5-10 SECONDS; PASSING ON THE LEFT. WE WERE ABLE TO OBSERVE IT FOR 10-15 MORE SECONDS; WHILE TRAVELING AT 120 KTS; I HAD TIME TO CONFIRM AIRSPEED; ALTITUDE; TIS-B DISPLAY; AND REFERENCE LOCATION; THEN STILL OBSERVE THE UAS - GATHERING THE MENTAL PICTURE TRYING TO IDENTIFY THE TYPE; SIZE; AND COLOR. UNKNOWN BLACK AND RED; POSSIBLE PARTIAL WING QUAD COPTER OR HEX+ COPTER. NO FURTHER INFORMATION. CONTINUED TO FME AT 1300 FT AND DID NOT ALTER ALTITUDE OR COURSE UNTIL WITHIN 5 NM OF AIRPORT. BUSY FREQUENCY AND OUTSIDE OF CLASS B; SO I DID NOT REPORT TO THE CONTROLLER.,SR20 pilot reported a near miss with a UAS at 1150 ft enroute to the RIISE waypoint between FME and ANP; 2 NM southeast of the WMPT TV tower.,2016,04
155,201604,NEW JERSEY,WELL PRIOR TO TOP OF DESCENT INTO EWR WE REVIEWED PERFORMANCE AND FM WIND SHEAR PRECAUTIONS; PROFILES; PROCEDURES AS EWR WAS LANDING RUNWAY 29 DUE TO HIGH WINDS AND LLWS ADVISORIES. WE ASSESSED AND CHOSE FLAPS 3 APPROACH AND INCORPORATED INTO BRIEF TO INCLUDE THE DEFINED TOUCHDOWN ZONE/GO AROUND POINT AND VERBAL REVIEW OF PROCEDURE.FIRST OFFICER FLEW A GOOD APPROACH IN VERY GUSTY CONDITIONS BUT WIND SHIFT AND GUST AT APPROXIMATELY 40 FEET IN TRANSITION TOWARDS FLARE CAUSED AUTO THRUST TO OVER CORRECT RESULTING IN A BALLOON/FLOAT. I DIRECTED A GO AROUND (GA) AS WE APPROACHED THE END OF OUR PRE BRIEFED TOUCHDOWN ZONE.WHILE DIRECTING THE GA AND MONITORING POWER/POSITION; I REVERTED TO NON-STANDARD PHRASEOLOGY (FROM MILITARY CAREER) WITH THE TOWER '... ON THE GO' VERSUS '... GOING AROUND'. IN THE SUBSEQUENT HIGH WORK LOAD OF TOWER VECTORS; 2 DIFFERENT ALTITUDE ASSIGNMENTS AND A SWITCH TO APPROACH FREQUENCY; I FAILED TO RECOGNIZE AND CORRECT THE FLAPS TO POSITION 2 FROM THE FLAPS 3 APPROACH POSITION. WE EVIDENTLY REVERTED TO AND CALLED THE NORMAL(FULL FLAP) GO AROUND PROFILE CALL OUTS AND CHECKED 'FLAPS 3' WHICH RESULTED IN A 5-10 KNOT FLAP OVER SPEED DURING THE GO AROUND.NEITHER TOWER NOR APPROACH ASKED THE REASON FOR THE GA AND IT WAS; FRANKLY; TOO BUSY A TIME TO GIVE ONE.  REBRIEFED SUBSEQUENT APPROACH WITH A SELECTED SPEED AND MANUAL THROTTLES TO MITIGATE ENGINE SPOOL UPS/DOWNS; AND THOUGH A CHALLENGING APPROACH; LANDED UNEVENTFULLY.,Extremely gusty winds prompted a crew to elect to do a go-around just prior to touchdown. The second approach was uneventful.,2016,04
156,201604,NEW YORK,WHILE BEING VECTORED TO THE LOC 31 AT LGA IN THE VICINITY OF THE DIALS INTERSECTION; I SPOTTED A DRONE OPERATING NEAR US. WE WERE AT 4000 FT MSL HEADED NE TO OVERFLY LGA. THE DRONE APPEARED TO BE A WHITE QUADCOPTER OPERATING AT OR SLIGHTLY BELOW OUR ALTITUDE APPROXIMATELY 2000 FT OFF OUR RIGHT SIDE HEADING WEST. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS REQUIRED BY US; WE CONTINUED ON OUR ASSIGNED HEADING AND ALTITUDE AND REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO ATC. THE FBI HAS SINCE FOLLOWED UP WITH ME.,Air carrier First Officer spotted a drone near their altitude of 4000 feet while on vectors to LGA Runway 31 near DIALS intersection. No evasive action was required.,2016,04
157,201604,NEW YORK,WHILE GETTING RADAR VECTORS TO RUNWAY 4 AFTER A RUNWAY CHANGE INTO LGA WE ENCOUNTERED A POSSIBLE UAV AT 8;000 FEET. THERE WAS NO APPARENT VERTICAL MOVEMENT IN THE OBJECT TO APPEAR LIKE A BALLOON RISING. THE OBJECT WAS BLACK IN COLOR; AND MAYBE NO MORE THAN A FEW HUNDRED FEET HORIZONTAL SEPARATION OF OUR AIRCRAFT [OFF] THE LEFT SIDE. WE WERE FLYING AN EASTERLY HEADING OVER NEW JERSEY NEAR THE NEW JERSEY TURNPIKE EXIT 8A.,Air carrier Captain reported a UAV at 8;000 feet near Jamesburg; NJ while on vectors to LGA Runway 4.,2016,04
158,201604,NORTH CAROLINA,WHILE ON A VISUAL APPROACH TO RWY 23 BACKED UP WITH THE ILS IN VMC CONDITIONS; WE WERE ADVISED WE WERE FOLLOWING A C130 BY APPROXIMATELY 5 NM. THE APPROACH WAS STABLE THROUGH MINIMUMS. BELOW 1100 MSL; WHICH IS DH FOR THE ILS; WE RECEIVED GPWS WARNINGS ABOUT THE GS. THIS IS NORMAL AS ONE OF THE NOTES ON THE ILS CHART INDICATE THE GS IS UNUSABLE BELOW 1100 MSL. WE ENTERED THE LOW ENERGY REGIME WITH INTENTIONS TO LAND. AS THE FLARE WAS INITIATED; WE CAUGHT EITHER A GUST OF WIND OR THE WAKE FROM THE PRECEDING C130; CAUSING US TO BALLOON UP APPROXIMATELY 50 FT ABOVE THE RUNWAY WITH RAPIDLY DECREASING AIRSPEED. THE FO/PF CALLED FOR AND EXECUTED A GO AROUND. HE SET MAX THRUST AND I ENSURED MAX THRUST WAS SET BECAUSE OF OUR HEIGHT ABOVE THE RUNWAY; DECREASING AIRSPEED; AND LOW KINETIC ENERGY. AS THE AIRPLANE STARTED TO ACCELERATE; WE MOMENTARILY HAD AN ENGINE OVERSPEED MESSAGE. I RESPONDED BY REDUCING THE THRUST SETTING. FOLLOWING ATC INSTRUCTIONS; WE CLIMBED TO 4000 ON A HEADING. WE WERE OFFERED OUR CHOICE OF RUNWAY. I CHOSE 18R DUE TO OUR CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THAT RUNWAY AND THAT WE WOULD BE FACING A FUEL SITUATION IF WE DID NOT LAND SOON. WE BRIEFED; SET UP FOR; AND RAN THE REQUIRED CHECKLISTS. AS WE ALIGNED WITH THE RUNWAY; I SAW THE FO WAS DEVIATING FROM THE GS. I DECIDED TO TAKE THE CONTROLS AT THIS POINT. THE SECOND APPROACH WAS STABILIZED WITH A NORMAL LANDING.WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE GATE; I CALLED MAINTENANCE TO ADVISE THEM OF THE ENGINE OVERSPEED AND AN ITT EXCEEDANCE DURING WHAT I SAID WAS A GO AROUND. SHORTLY AFTER GETTING OFF THE PHONE; I STARTED THIS ASAP AND IN DESCRIBING THE EVENT; CAME TO REALIZE IT WAS A BALKED LANDING; NOT A GO AROUND.,CRJ-200 Captain reported executing a low altitude go-around at CLT when the flight ballooned as a result of either a gust of wind or a wake turbulence encounter.,2016,04
159,201604,TEXAS,I WAS WORKING ALL EAST SIDE SECTORS COMBINED AND THE IAH FINALS. THIS WAS MID-SHIFT OPERATION. AN AIR CARRIER WAS INBOUND TO IAH FROM THE NORTHEAST. I ISSUED AN APPROACH CLEARANCE AND A FEW MINUTES LATER THE PILOT REPORTED A NEAR MISS WITH AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE. THE PILOT REPORTED A 3-5 FT TUBULAR AIRCRAFT AT 8;500 FT PASSED 'VERY CLOSE' TO THEIR AIRCRAFT. THE PILOT CALLED IN ON THE PHONE LATER TO CONFIRM DETAILS AND SAID THE UAV WAS LARGE ENOUGH TO HAVE TAKEN DOWN THEIR AIRCRAFT HAD THEY HIT IT. IT WAS UNLIT AND GREY IN COLOR. ALL THREE PEOPLE IN THE COCKPIT SAW IT. THE CO-PILOT DESCRIBED IT AS LOOKING LIKE A FIXED WING LONG AIRCRAFT. THEY CONTINUED WITH THE APPROACH AND THERE WERE NO SUBSEQUENT SIGHTINGS. I TURNED OFF ALL FILTERING ON MY SCOPE AND STILL COULD NOT SEE ANY RETURNS IN THE AREA THAT COULD BE IDENTIFIED. THIS OCCURRED WITHIN THE CLASS-B AIRSPACE.,I90 TRACON Controller reported on an air carrier Flight Crew report of a near miss with a UAV while on approach to IAH.,2016,04
160,201604,TEXAS,WHILE CLIMBING THROUGH FL240 TO LEVEL AT FL250; OUR AIRCRAFT WAS NEARLY HIT BY A MAN MADE OBJECT WHICH LOOKED TO BE A DRONE. IT WAS BLACK AND SILVER IN APPEARANCE WITH SOME KIND OF LIGHT ON IT AND LOOKED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 2-3 FEET IN DIAMETER. WE WERE FLYING THE RNAV DEPARTURE WITH THE AUTOPILOT ENGAGED. OUR APPROXIMATE HEADING AT THE TIME OF THE INCIDENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 063 AND THE OBJECT APPEARED TO COME AT US AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE; CROSSING IN FRONT OF THE COCKPIT FROM LEFT TO RIGHT; MISSING THE AIRCRAFT BY 200-300 FEET AT OUR ALTITUDE. I AM UNSURE OF HOW FAST THE OBJECT WAS MOVING; BUT WE WERE CLIMBING AT 290KTS IAS.  THE FIRST OFFICER WAS THE PILOT FLYING; AND DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT. WE WERE IN RADAR CONTACT AND TALKING WITH FORT WORTH CENTER AND THE SIGHTING WAS PROMPTLY REPORTED TO THEM; AT WHICH TIME THEY ALERTED OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA OF THE OBJECT. THEY HAD NO TRACK ON THE OBJECT; AND OUR AIRCRAFT NEVER GENERATED A TCAS ALERT. I WAS QUITE SHOCKED TO SEE SOMETHING LIKE THIS AT THAT ALTITUDE; I HAD NO IDEA THAT SOMETHING THAT SIZE COULD BE UP THAT HIGH.,Air carrier Captain climbing through FL240 reported a near miss with a UAS approximately 2-3 feet in diameter.,2016,04
161,201605,ILLINOIS,ON A FLIGHT OUT OF ORD I NOTICED A DARK COLORED DRONE FLYING OFF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT AFTER DEPARTING RUNWAY 9R. IT WAS SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF AND I NOTICED WHILE WE WERE CLIMBING THROUGH ABOUT 2500 MSL. IT LOOKED STRANGE AND OUT OF PLACE SO IT REALLY CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. IT WAS NOT MOVING FAST IF AT ALL AND PASSED SEVERAL HUNDRED YARDS OFF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT.I NOTIFIED DEPARTURE CONTROL AND THEY FOLLOWED UP WITH SEVERAL QUESTIONS. I TOLD THEM THE COLOR AND ALTITUDE AND FIX OFF OF A GROUND LOCATION FOR THEM. I SAID THAT IT WAS OVER THE DES PLAINS RIVER NEAR SOME FOREST PRESERVE AREA. WE CONTINUED OUR FLIGHT WITHOUT INCIDENT.,Air carrier First Officer reported sighting a UAV at 2;500 ft during climbout from ORD Runway 9R.,2016,05
162,201605,ILLINOIS,THIS NARRATIVE IS TO DOCUMENT A NEAR MISS WITH A DRONE THAT WAS IN A PLACE IT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN. MY FIRST OFFICER SAW IT AND DESCRIBED IT AS SHINY PURPLE; AT LEAST 2 FEET ACROSS; 50 FEET ABOVE US; AND 50 FEET TO OUR RIGHT. OUR POSITION WAS APPROXIMATELY 1 MILE OUTSIDE THE TAFFS FAF ON THE ILS TO 27L AT ORD. ALTITUDE WAS APPROXIMATELY 2500 FEET MSL. ENCOUNTER WAS REPORTED TO CHICAGO APPROACH IN REAL TIME. WE HEARD THEM REPORT IT TO AIRCRAFT BEHIND US JUST BEFORE WE SWITCHED TO ORD TOWER @ TAFFS. ONCE PARKED AT THE GATE WE DISCUSSED WHAT REPORT; IF ANY; WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND NONE CAME TO MIND. MY FO HEADED FOR HIS COMMUTER FLIGHT AND I TOOK THE TIME TO CALL [OPERATIONS] TO DOCUMENT THE ENCOUNTER. THIS REPORT IS BEING FILED AT HIS SUGGESTION.,B757 Captain reported a near miss with an UAV a mile from TAFFS on the ORD ILS Runway 27L. The encounter was reported to Approach Control and advisories were issued to other aircraft.,2016,05
163,201605,INDIANA,THERE WAS A WEATHER BALLOON LAUNCHED EARLIER IN THE DAY AND WHEN I GOT BACK ON POSITION IT HAD STARTED ITS DESCENT. WE DID NOT HAVE ANY RELIABLE DATA FOR WHERE THIS WEATHER BALLOON WAS EXCEPT FOR WHAT THE SUPERVISOR WAS TELLING US FROM THE COMPUTER WHICH WAS TRACKING IT VIA GPS. WE HAD ONE AIRCRAFT THAT GOT A VISUAL ON IT FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME BUT COULDN'T MAINTAIN SIGHT OF IT SO THE AIRCRAFT STARTED TO MANEUVER TO AVOID THE AREA WHERE THE BALLOON WAS LAST SEEN. THE AIRCRAFT THAT REPORTED SEEING IT INDICATED HE THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT THE SAME ALTITUDE AT FL380 WHILE THE SUPERVISOR INFORMATION WAS SHOWING THAT THE BALLOON WAS AT FL300. I WAS WORKING THE RSH SECTOR AND THE BALLOON WAS LAST REPORTED RIGHT ABOVE ALL OF THE ORD INBOUNDS THAT I HAD AT FL280. I MADE NUMEROUS CALLS AS TO WHERE THE BALLOON WAS LAST SIGHTED AND WHAT THE LAST KNOWN ALTITUDE WAS BUT I HAD NO VALID INFORMATION AS TO WHERE THIS BALLOON WAS IN RELATION TO THE AIRPLANES IN MY SECTOR. THIS HAS TO BE ONE OF THE MOST UNSAFE THINGS THAT I HAVE WITNESSED. FOR THERE TO BE AN UNMANNED BALLOON GOING TO ALMOST FL1000 AND THEN BACK TO THE GROUND RIGHT THROUGH A MAJOR STREAM OF AIRCRAFT AND A BUSY AIRWAY WITHOUT THE ABILITY TO SEE IT OR GIVE TRAFFIC INFORMATION MADE ME FEEL HELPLESS WHEN ADVISING THESE AIRCRAFT ABOUT THE HAZARD THAT WAS FLYING IN FRONT OF THEM. IT FELT LIKE I WAS TRYING TO TELL THE AIRCRAFT HOW TO FIND THE NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK HOPING THAT THEY DIDN'T GET THEIR FINGER PRICKED WHILE THEY WERE LOOKING ONLY THE FINGER PRICK WOULD HAVE BEEN AN AIRCRAFT HITTING A 12LB OBJECT ON A BALLOON. I WOULD RECOMMEND THAT ANY BALLOON THAT IS GOING TO GO INTO THE CLASS A AIRSPACE HAS TO HAVE AN OPERATING TRANSPONDER SO THAT WE CAN TRACK WHERE IT IS AND PROVIDE ACCURATE INFORMATION TO THE AIRCRAFT THAT ARE IN OUR SECTORS. WITHOUT AN OPERATING TRANSPONDER THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO LAUNCH THE BALLOON PERIOD.,ZID Controller reported of a weather balloon that was not equipped to show where its location was. Controller reported aircraft saw the balloon and reported it to him. Controller thought this was an unsafe practice.,2016,05
164,201605,NEW YORK,FLYING IN LEVEL CRUISE FLIGHT AT 7000 FEET; ON A HEADING OF 060; AT 155 KTS IAS; 10 MILES NE OF JFK; WE SPOT A SMALL WHITE OBJECT AHEAD; SLIGHTLY BELOW; AND TO THE RIGHT OF OUR PLANE. WE ARE CLOSING FAST YET CLEARLY SAW THAT IT WAS A DRONE/WHITE QUADCOPTER WITH A WHITE LIGHT. WHEN WE PASSED THE DRONE (APPROXIMATELY 5-10 SECONDS LATER); IT WAS 100 FEET HORIZONTALLY FROM OUR RIGHT WING AND 50 FEET BELOW US. WE WERE UNABLE TO TELL THE DIRECTION IT WAS FLYING. IT WAS CLEARLY A CLOSE CALL. WE NOTIFIED JFK APPROACH; HE WARNED OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA; AND GAVE US A NUMBER TO CALL UPON LANDING.,A small aircraft pilot in cruise at 7;000 ft 10 miles northeast of JFK reported a near miss with a UAV.,2016,05
165,201605,NEW YORK,FLIGHT TO LGA WAS TURNING FINAL DESCENT FROM 3000 TO 2000 FT. A TCAS TA ALERT FROM DRONE WAS RECEIVED IN THE COCKPIT; FROM THE TCAS SYSTEM REPORTING 200 FT BELOW TA CALL OUT; TWICE AFTER VISUAL SIGHTING OF THE DRONE BY THE FO.BE MORE AWARE OF POSSIBLE DRONE INCURSIONS INTO CONTROLLED AIRSPACE DURING TAKEOFF AND LANDING.,B737 flight crew reported a TCAS TA alert descending from 3;000 to 2;000 ft while turning a left base leg to final for LGA Runway 22.,2016,05
166,201605,NORTH DAKOTA,DURING UAS AND CHASE OBSERVER AIRCRAFT ORBITAL CLIMB TO 7000 MSL ATC (APPROACH) BEGAN TO ISSUE ADVISORIES TO A VFR AIRCRAFT FLYING THE VICTOR AIRWAY AND OURSELVES FOLLOWING THE UAS TO MAINTAIN SEPARATION. THE OTHER TRAFFIC CALLED THE UAS IN SIGHT AND MANEUVERED TO MAINTAIN SEPARATION. LATER RADAR DATA ESTIMATED THAT THE VFR TRAFFIC CAME WITHIN 0.9 MILES OF THE OPERATING UAS WHILE MANEUVERING TO MAINTAIN SEPARATION.,C182 pilot flying chase during a UAV test; reported an airborne conflict with a VFR PA44. ATC issued advisories to the PA44 pilot.,2016,05
167,201605,TENNESSEE,ON LEFT BASE TO A VISUAL APPROACH; TO RUNWAY 31; WE HAD A NEAR MISS WITH A DRONE AT 3700 FEET MSL. I FIRST SAW THE DRONE AT OUR LEFT 10 O'CLOCK; AND APPROXIMATELY 50 TO 100 FT AWAY (HARD TO TELL WITHOUT KNOWING THE ACTUAL SIZE OF THE THING). IT HAD A WHITE BODY WITH BLUE HIGHLIGHTS AND BLACK PROPELLER GUARDS. NOT SURE IF IT HAD 4 OR 6 PROPS. I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED APPROACH. AFTER LANDING; GROUND GAVE US A PHONE NUMBER TO MAKE A REPORT.,Air carrier Captain flying the Runway 31 visual approach at BNA reported a UAV near miss at 3;700 feet.,2016,05
168,201605,TEXAS,I WAS CONDUCTING TRAINING ON THE LOCAL 1 POSITION. I OBSERVED THE TRAINEE ENQUIRE ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH AIRCRAFT X/BE36 WHO HADN'T CALL BUT WAS IN OUR AIRSPACE 3.5 NNE OF FTW. AIRCRAFT X CHECKED IN 2 NORTH OF THE AIRPORT LANDING RY34. THE TRAINEE INSTRUCTED AIRCRAFT X TO WIDEN OUT THEIR RIGHT DOWNWIND FOR RY34. AIRCRAFT X FLEW THROUGH THE DEPARTURE CORRIDOR OF RY34 AND ENTERED THE LEFT DOWNWIND AT WHICH TIME THE TRAINEE ENQUIRED AS TO WHAT AIRCRAFT X WAS DOING. THE ONLY TRAFFIC INVOLVED WAS AIRCRAFT Y AHEAD ON THE DOWNWIND FOR RY35 OF AIRCRAFT X AND AIRCRAFT Z ON A 2 MILE FINAL. THE TRAINEE POINTED OUT AIRCRAFT Z ON A 2 MILE FINAL FOR RY34 TO FOLLOW AND TO CONTINUE DOWNWIND. THE TRAINEE ISSUED TOUCH AND GO CLEARANCE ON RY35 TO AIRCRAFT Y AND AGAIN ISSUED SEQUENCE TO AIRCRAFT X TO FOLLOW AIRCRAFT Z NOW ON A MILE FINAL. AIRCRAFT X INDICATED THEY WERE TURNING BASE BUT THERE WAS TRAFFIC ON A MILE FINAL. THE TRAINEE INFORMED AIRCRAFT X THAT THAT WAS AIRCRAFT Z HE WAS TO FOLLOW. AIRCRAFT X ACKNOWLEDGED SEQUENCE TO FOLLOW AIRCRAFT Z; WHO WAS DOING A TOUCH AND GO ON RY34. A UAS PILOT CALLED INDICATING THEY WERE ONE MINUTE FROM THEIR OPERATIONS AND THE TRAINEE ACKNOWLEDGED AND REQUESTED TO ADVISE WHEN TERMINATING OPERATIONS. THE TRAINEE ALONG WITH MYSELF SCANNED TO ENSURE RUNWAY SPACING WAS ADEQUATE (WHICH THERE WAS) WITH AIRCRAFT Z DOING A TOUCH AND GO AND AIRCRAFT X WHO APPEARED TO BE ON A HALF MILE FINAL LINED UP WITH THE RY34. MY TRAINEE AND I SCANNED RY35 TO CHECK THE LOCATION OF AIRCRAFT Y WHICH CAUSED US TO TURN AWAY FROM RY34. I UPDATED MY PAD WHEN MY TRAINEE; WHO TURNED TO CHECK WHERE AIRCRAFT X WAS BEFORE ME; MENTIONED 'DID THAT BONANZA JUST LAND ON TAXIWAY ALPHA!' AT WHICH POINT I LOOKED AND OBSERVED AIRCRAFT X ROLLING OUT ON TAXIWAY ALPHA NORTH OF ALPHA SIX. MY TRAINEE ADVISED AIRCRAFT X TWICE TO HOLD POSITION THAT HE HAD JUST LANDED ON TAXIWAY ALPHA AND OF POSSIBLE PILOT DEVIATION. THE TRAINEE THEN SWITCHED AIRCRAFT X TO GROUND CONTROL AND INFORMED AIRCRAFT X THEY WOULD GIVE THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL.THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME A PILOT HAS MISTAKEN TAXIWAY ALPHA FOR A RUNWAY. SINCE THE CONSTRUCTION OF TAXIWAY ALPHA THIS HAS OCCURRED. THE FACILITY AND THE AIRPORT HAVE TRIED TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM FROM RENAMING 16L/34R AND 16R/34L TO 16/34 AND 17/35; TO PAINTING 'T A X I W A Y' ON TAXIWAY ALPHA; TO PLACING LARGE ' X'S ' OFF EACH END OF TAXIWAY ALPHA; TO CONDUCTING PILOT BRIEFINGS; INFORMING PILOTS WHO QUESTION WHICH ONE IS THE RUNWAY THAT 'IT'S THE ONE WITH THE SQUARE END' AND IT STILL HAPPENS. IN THIS CASE AND I BELIEVE EVERY OTHER CASE; NOTHING WAS ON TAXIWAY ALPHA WHEN THIS OCCURS.I'M NOT SURE THERE IS MUCH ELSE WE CAN DO TO KEEP A PILOT FROM LANDING ON A TAXIWAY THAT LOOK JUST LIKE A RUNWAY.,FTW Tower Local Instructor and Developmental reported an aircraft landed on a taxiway instead of the runway.,2016,05
169,201605,WEST VIRGINIA,APPROACHING CRW FROM THE NORTHWEST; WE WERE CLEARED DIRECT TO THE FAF FOR THE ILS RUNWAY 23; INSTRUCTED TO MAINTAIN 4;000 FEET AND EXPECT A VISUAL APPROACH RUNWAY 23. AT THIS POINT; WE WERE APPROXIMATELY 10 NM FROM THE FIELD; WITH THE RUNWAY IN SIGHT.DURING THE ARRIVAL BRIEFING; WE HAD DISCUSSED THE TERRAIN AROUND THE AIRPORT TO BE AWARE OF; AS WELL AS THE NECESSITY TO BACK UP THE APPROACH WITH THE ILS; AS WELL AS THE PAPI VISUAL INDICATORS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RUNWAY SINCE IT WOULD BE DUSK BY THE TIME WE WERE ON THE APPROACH. ABOUT 3-5 MILES FROM THE MARKER; THE CONTROLLER ASKED US TO 'KEEP IT CLOSE IN' TO ALLOW A MILITARY AIRCRAFT TO FOLLOW US TO THE FIELD. AS I TURNED A RIGHT BASE (APPROXIMATELY 4 MILES NORTH OF THE FIELD); I CALLED FOR 'GEAR DOWN; FLAPS 22' AND WAS DESCENDING THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 2;800 FEET WITH THE RUNWAY AND PAPI IN SIGHT. JUST AFTER THE PILOT MONITORING SELECTED THE GEAR AND FLAPS; WE RECEIVED A SINGLE 'TERRAIN' AURAL WARNING; FOLLOWED BY 'LANDING GEAR'. I IMMEDIATELY BEGAN A CLIMB; TURNED TOWARD THE FIELD; AND SUBSEQUENTLY CALLED FOR A GO-AROUND. THE TOWER INSTRUCTED US TO MAINTAIN 3;000 FEET AND TO ENTER A RIGHT DOWNWIND. WE THEN COMPLETED A NORMAL APPROACH TO LANDING RUNWAY 23 BACKED UP BY THE ILS.THREATS WERE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN; DUSK CONDITIONS; ATC REQUESTING 'CLOSE IN' APPROACH. [OUR] ERRORS: ACCEPTING A CHALLENGING APPROACH CLEARANCE RESULTING IN A UNWANTED AIRCRAFT STATE (UAS). UAS: AIRCRAFT ENDED UP IN A POSITION THAT TRIGGERED A TERRAIN WARNING.DESPITE THE FACT WE HAD DISCUSSED THE THREATS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ARRIVAL AIRPORT; I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE RUSHED AT THE SUGGESTION OF ATC. IN HINDSIGHT; WE NEVER SHOULD HAVE ACCEPTED A SHORT APPROACH CLEARANCE AT AN UNFAMILIAR AIRPORT IN DUSK CONDITIONS. I SHOULD HAVE HAD THE PILOT MONITORING REQUEST VECTORS BEHIND THE OTHER TRAFFIC APPROACHING THE FIELD; OR EVEN BETTER; VECTORS TO THE INSTRUMENT APPROACH.,Air carrier regional jet Captain reported receiving a GPWS Terrain warning during a night visual approach to CRW.,2016,05
170,201606,CALIFORNIA,AIRCRAFT X REPORTED PASSING VERY CLOSELY TO A WEATHER BALLOON. HE STATED IT PASSED BETWEEN HIS WINGTIP AND HIS NUMBER ONE ENGINE. I DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT WEATHER BALLOONS BUT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO BE ABLE TO TRACK THEM SO WE COULD WARN AIRCRAFT OF THEIR PRESENCE.,ZLA ARTCC Controller reported a military aircraft pilot reported a near miss with a weather balloon.,2016,06
171,201606,CALIFORNIA,VECTORS ON APPROACH TO OAK OVER THE TOWN OF PLEASANTON; CA AT 5;000 FEET. NEAR MISS WITH A WHITE DRONE. ADVISED ATC OF THE EVENT.GET THOSE THINGS OUT OF THE SKY!,Air carrier Captain reported a near miss with a UAV at 5;000 ft over Pleasanton; CA.,2016,06
172,201606,CALIFORNIA,WHILE ON THE ILS 25L; MY FO STATED; 'IS THAT A BIRD?' AND POINTED TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. AS I TURNED TO LOOK AT WHAT THE FO WAS POINTING AT; HE STATED THAT HE SAW A UAV OF SOME SORT TO THE LEFT OF THE APPROACH COURSE. I DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT.,Air carrier Captain reported that the First Officer saw a UAS off the aircraft's left on approach to LAX. The Captain did not see it.,2016,06
173,201606,GEORGIA,WE WERE DESCENDING ON THE ARRIVAL THROUGH 9000 FT AND SOMETHING FLEW BY OUR RIGHT WING. IT MAY HAVE BEEN A DRONE. MY FIRST OFFICER SAW IT; BUT I DID NOT. WE REPORTED IT TO ATC.,B737 Captain reported possibly encountering a drone that flew by the right wing while descending through 9000 ft on approach to ATL near POORS.,2016,06
174,201606,ILLINOIS,AIRCRAFT X WAS INSTRUCTED TO LINE UP AND WAIT ON RUNWAY 28R. AFTER ISSUING A TAKEOFF CLEARANCE; THE PILOT ADVISED HE HAD 'RED LIGHTS'. I THEN INSTRUCTED THE AIRCRAFT TO HOLD IN POSITION AND RESCANNED THE RUNWAY AT WHICH POINT I NOTICED AN UNIDENTIFIED VEHICLE CROSSING AT TAXIWAY 'F' MOVING IN A SOUTHBOUND DIRECTION. AFTER VERIFYING THAT THERE WERE NO FURTHER CONFLICTS; I THEN ONCE AGAIN CLEARED THE AIRCRAFT FOR TAKEOFF.RWSL [RUNWAY SAFETY LIGHTS] WORKED AS INTENDED IN THIS INSTANCE; RECOMMEND INSTALLING THIS SAFETY FEATURE IN ALL RUNWAYS AT ORD.,ORD Tower Controller reported clearing an aircraft for takeoff. Pilot reported they had 'red lights on the runway'. Controller advised pilot to hold position and observed an automobile on the runway. After vehicle was cleared aircraft was given takeoff clearance again. Controller liked the fact that the Runway Safety Lights Worked.,2016,06
175,201606,ILLINOIS,DEPARTING VFR FROM RUNWAY 26 AT 3CK; I PLANNED TO DO A LEFT DOWNWIND EXIT FROM THE TRAFFIC PATTERN AND CONTINUE EASTBOUND TO MY HOME AIRPORT. THE WEATHER WAS CAVU AND HOT AND SUNNY; WITH A SLIGHTLY GUSTY WIND.NEARING THE MIDFIELD POINT IN THE DOWNWIND AT ABOUT 1000 FT AGL; I NOTICED WHAT I FIRST BELIEVED TO BE AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION AIRPLANE HEADING TOWARD ME. A NORMAL 30 DEGREE BANK WAS SUFFICIENT TO MANEUVER TO AVOID IT. GETTING A LITTLE CLOSER; I REALIZED IT WAS NOT A MANNED AIRCRAFT; BUT RATHER A TINY DRONE (AND WAS THEREFORE MUCH CLOSER TO ME THAN I INITIALLY THOUGHT). NO ABNORMAL MANEUVERING WAS NEEDED TO MISS THE DRONE; THOUGH I PROBABLY WOULD HAVE HIT IT; HAD I NOT SEEN IT OR TAKEN ACTION.NO ONE ELSE WAS IN THE PATTERN AND THE RADIO WAS QUIET; BUT I NONETHELESS BROADCASTED A WARNING TO OTHERS OVER CTAF. I ESTIMATE THE DRONE WAS AT 1000 FT AGL; ABOUT 1 MILE NORTH OF 3CK. I NEVER SAW IT TURN OR EVADE; SO I PRESUME ITS OPERATOR WAS UNAWARE OF THE CONFLICT... THOUGH HE/SHE WAS PROBABLY UNAWARE OF A LOT OF THINGS IF HE THINKS OPERATING AT 1000 FT NEXT TO AN AIRPORT IS OKAY.,A pilot reported a near miss with a UAV at 1000 feet AGL while on downwind departing 3CK.,2016,06
176,201606,MARYLAND,INITIALLY; I WAS LOOKING INSIDE THE COCKPIT PERFORMING NFP PRE-LANDING DUTIES. PIC STARTLED ME AS HE BROUGHT MY ATTENTION OUTSIDE. I LOOKED UP IN TIME ENOUGH TO SEE THE DRONE; SHINING AND STABLE PASSING LESS THAN 300 FEET OFF THE STARBOARD SIDE. IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABOUT 5 FEET IN LENGTH. IT PASSED LESS THAN 300 FEET BELOW US. MY GUT IS THAT IT MAY HAVE BEEN AS CLOSE AS 150 BELOW AND 200 STARBOARD. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED TRACON; BUT SHE WAS OCCUPIED AND DELAYED IN RESPONDING TO ME. WHEN I GOT HER ATTENTION I REPORTED US HAVING PASSED A DRONE; THE CONTROLLER DID NOT SEEM CONCERNED AND DID NOT ASK ANY QUESTIONS. I EVEN ASKED THAT SHE COPIED MY REPORT - SHE ACKNOWLEDGED AND WENT ON ABOUT HER DUTIES. MY FELLOW PILOT AND I LATER DEBRIEFED ON THE INCIDENT AND AGREED THAT IT WAS A DRONE; IT APPEARED GRAY AND BLACK; MAYBE WITH WHITE; AND WE AGREED ON OUR ESTIMATIONS OF THE APPROXIMATE POSITION OF IT PASSING OUR AIRCRAFT.A CURSORY SEARCH DOES NOT AVAIL A DRONE REPORTING SYSTEM; AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT EITHER ONE BE CREATED OR THAT THIS ASRS SYSTEM PROVIDE ACCOUNTING FOR DRONES. I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW WHAT IF ANYTHING CAN BE CONFIRMED ABOUT THIS INCIDENT; AND EXPRESS MY SERIOUS CONCERN FOR A DRONE AT 6800 MSL; UNREPORTED; WITHOUT TCAS; AND PASSING SO CLOSE TO MANNED AIRCRAFT.,Light Jet Air taxi First Officer reported a near miss with a UAV at 7;000 ft while flying a straight in visual approach to SBY Runway 14. TRACON Controller showed no interest in the event.,2016,06
177,201606,NEW JERSEY,WHILE FLYING THE ILS 22L INTO EWR WE HEARD AN AIRCRAFT IN FRONT OF US REPORT THAT 'THEY MAY HAVE JUST FLOWN PAST A DRONE'. THE TOWER THEN ASKED US TO BE SURE WE HEARD THE REPORT. I WAS THE PILOT MONITORING SO WAS LOOKING INTENTLY FOR THE DRONE. AT ABOUT 420 MSL THE DRONE CAME INTO SIGHT ABOVE AND TO THE RIGHT OF OUR FLIGHT PATH. THE FO ALSO HAD IT IN SIGHT AND NO DEVIATIONS WERE NEEDED. IT ALL HAPPENED VERY FAST AND THE OBJECT WAS QUITE A BLUR. IT APPEARED TO BE BROWN OR GREY IN COLOR AND THE OUTLINE OF CIRCULAR ROTOR BLADES VISIBLE. SIZE; SPEED AND DIRECTION OF TRAVEL IMPOSSIBLE TO TELL. IT APPEARED STATIONARY FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BUT MAY BE BECAUSE OF THE LARGE SPEED DIFFERENTIAL. WE LANDED COMPLETELY NORMALLY OTHER THAN SPOTTING THE DRONE. WE VERBALLY REPORTED TO THE TOWER AND ALSO WERE MET BY POLICE WHO WANTED A DESCRIPTION AS WELL.,An air carrier crew was notified by EWR Tower about an earlier UAS sighting. They also detected the UAS at about 420 feet; but the craft's details were difficult to determine.,2016,06
178,201606,NEW YORK,WHILE ON VFR HELICOPTER ROUTE (KNOWN AS THE 'THROGS ROUTE') IN LGA CLASS B AIRSPACE HEADING WESTBOUND ON THE ROUTE; ATC CALLED OUT 'OPPOSITE DIRECTION HELICOPTER'. WHILE SEARCHING FOR TRAFFIC WE THOUGHT WE SPOTTED WHAT LOOKED LIKE TO BE A HELICOPTER APPROXIMATELY AT OUR ONE O'CLOCK POSITION. AS IT GOT CLOSER WE REALIZED IT WASN'T A HELICOPTER. INITIALLY WE THOUGHT IT WAS A LARGE BUNCH OF BALLOONS; BUT AS IT PASSED US WE REALIZED IT WAS A LARGE DRONE THAT HAD FOUR SEPARATE (ROTORS).WE REPORTED WHAT WE SAW TO LGA TOWER.WE SPOTTED THE REAL HELICOPTER THAT WAS OPPOSITE DIRECTION AT ABOUT OUR ELEVEN O'CLOCK POSITION. IT POSED NO FACTOR TO US AND PASSED US. THE TOWER ASKED THEM WHAT THEY SAW AND THEY CONFIRMED IT WAS A DRONE.  THE DRONE WAS AT APPROXIMATELY 1;300 FEET AND PASSED OFF OUR RIGHT SIDE ABOUT A MILE AWAY.,A Helicopter Pilot at 1;500 feet reported sighting a large UAV at about 1;300 feet near the VFR Helicopter Throgs Route.,2016,06
179,201606,VIRGINIA,PASSENGER REPORTED SEEING A LARGE DRONE FLYING JUST NEAR THE WINGTIP OF THE AIRPLANE. DRONE WAS DESCRIBED AS 3 FEET IN LENGTH; DARK GREY IN COLOR AND SPHERICAL IN SHAPE. STATED THAT IT HAD AN ARM WITH A CAMERA AND A GREEN BLINKING LIGHT AND JUST MISSED THE WING OF THE AIRPLANE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE. ALTITUDE WAS APPROXIMATELY 17;000 FT WHEN IT WAS REPORTED TO THE CREW.,An EMB-175 Captain reported being advised by a Flight Attendant that a passenger witnessed a dark grey; spherically shaped UAS three feet long flew near their aircraft's wingtip at some point during departure.,2016,06
180,201607,ARIZONA,WHILE APPROACHING 25L AT PHX I ENCOUNTERED A DRONE AT APPROXIMATELY 500-700 FEET AGL. I MADE A RADIO CALL TO THE TOWER REPORTING IT; AND THE TOWER REPLIED THAT THEY COULD ALSO SEE IT VISUALLY. IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 50 FEET HIGH AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE AIRPLANE. IT WAS BLACK; WITH 4 MOTORS. ROUGHLY THE SIZE OF A MICROWAVE. I DID NOT HAVE TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION; AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT.,The pilot of a single engine transport aircraft reported seeing a UAV while on final approach to PHX Runway 25L. No evasive action was required and; after reporting the sighting to the Tower; he landed without incident.,2016,07
181,201607,ILLINOIS,SPOTTED DRONE APPROXIMATELY 2.5 MILE FINAL 27L AT 1300 MSL ABOUT 1 MILE SOUTH OF COURSE. NOTIFIED ATC AND DISPATCH.,Air carrier Captain reported a UAS 1 mile south of ORD Runway 27L at 1;300 ft on a 2.5 mile final.,2016,07
182,201607,ILLINOIS,WE WERE ON FINAL APPROACH FOR 9L OVER DOOGY AT 3000 FEET WE GOT A TRAFFIC ALERT AND THEN A MONITOR VERTICAL SPEED FOR TRAFFIC BELOW US AT 2;500 FEET. WE DID NOT GET A CLIMB OR DESCENT; WE DID NOT DEVIATE FROM ANYTHING ASSIGNED TO US. BUT WE DID REPORT TO CHICAGO TOWER THAT THERE WAS A DRONE BELOW OUR AIRCRAFT.THE ONLY THREAT WE HAD WAS THAT WE COULD HAVE POSSIBLY COLLIDED WITH THE DRONE AND POSSIBLY AN UNSTABLE APPROACH FROM TRYING TO FIND THE DRONE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IT WAS BUT WE DID NOT HAVE ANY ERRORS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SITUATION.,EMB145 flight crew reported a possible drone sighting at 3;000 feet over DOOGY on approach to ORD Runway 9L. A TCAS RA was generated to; 'Monitor Vertical Speed' for the traffic 500 feet below.,2016,07
183,201607,NEW HAMPSHIRE,TWO UAS/UAV (DRONES) IN THE SAME DAY! FIRST WAS AT 4500 FEET DURING TRAINING WITH A STUDENT DIRECTLY OVER CON. OUR BEST ESTIMATE WAS THE DRONE AT 3000 FEET AND 1/4 MILE NW OF THE AIRPORT. IT WAS UNUSUALLY BRIGHT CHROME IN COLOR. SEVERAL PASSES VERIFIED THAT IT WAS A DRONE/UAV. LATER IN THE SAME DAY ANOTHER DARK COLORED DRONE WAS IN NEARLY THE SAME LOCATION (WITH A DIFFERENT STUDENT) WHILE WE WERE ON BASE LEG AT 1200 FEET MSL. THE DRONE WAS ABOUT 200 FEET ABOVE; AT PATTERN ALTITUDE AND WOULD HAVE BEEN A HAZARD TO ANY AIRCRAFT IN THE PATTERN. FAA WAS NOTIFIED ON BOTH EVENTS AND PER THEIR REQUEST; I NOTIFIED THE POLICE TO REPORT THE TWO EVENTS. THE POLICE DID COME OUT LATE PM TO TAKE A REPORT OF THE DRONE ACTIVITY AND SAID THEY WOULD INVESTIGATE! THIS IS MY 4TH SIGHTING IN A MONTH AT THIS AIRPORT. THE OTHER TWO WERE QUITE LOW AND SEEMED NO HAZARD; ALTHOUGH DEFINITELY IN THE CON AIRSPACE! BOTH STUDENTS SAID THEY WERE COMFORTABLE REPORTING WHAT THEY HAD SEEN; AS WELL. NOT A SAFE PLACE FOR AMATEUR DRONE DRIVERS!,C172 instructor pilot reported sighting two UAV's on the same day over CON airport with one at 1400 feet the other at 3000 feet.,2016,07
184,201607,NEW JERSEY,ON ILS 04R APPROACH EWR WE WERE INFORMED THAT A DRONE WAS REPORTED IN OUR VICINITY. AS ATC WAS TELLING US THIS THE PM SPOTTED THE WHITE DRONE 500 FEET RIGHT OF OUR FLIGHT PATH AND ABOUT 50 FEET BELOW US. HE REPORTED IT TO ATC ALONG WITH THE COLOR.,BAE125 Captain reported being informed by ATC of a drone in the vicinity of the EWR ILS Runway 04R before sighting it 500 feet to the right of the localizer.,2016,07
185,201607,NEW YORK,NEAR MISS WITH A DRONE INSIDE IAG AIRPORT TRAFFIC AREA ON FINAL APPROACH AT 2000 MSL. DRONE PASSED ABOVE BY 20 FEET AND LEFT BY 10 FEET. REPORTED EVENT TO NIAGARA FALLS TOWER. TOWER COULD SEE THE DRONE VIA BINOCULARS. THEY DISPATCHED LOCAL AUTHORITIES TO ATTEMPT TO LOCATE THE OPERATOR.,PA28 instructor pilot reported a NMAC with a drone at 2000 feet MSL while on final approach to IAG Runway 24.,2016,07
186,201607,OHIO,ENCOUNTERED 2 DRONES WHILE INFLIGHT [NEAR] 4G4 WHILE MAINTAINING 2500 FEET MSL (HEADING 323 DEGREES). THE PILOT SEATED IN THE LEFT FRONT CREW SEAT CALLED OUT 'TWO DRONES AT 11 AND 12 O'CLOCK.'  BOTH DRONES APPEARED TO BE WELL WITHIN 500 FEET OF THE AIRCRAFT; AND AT THE SAME ALTITUDE. AN IMMEDIATE CLIMB OF 1000 FEET WAS INITIATED AND CALLS WERE MADE TO APPROACH CONTROL AND OPERATIONS. THE DRONES WERE ILLUMINATED. THE FIRST ONE TO BE AND APPEARED TO BE RED IN COLOR; AND THE SECOND DRONE APPEARED TO BE WHITE. THE FLIGHT CONTINUED WITHOUT INCIDENT.,Helicopter pilot flying at 2;500 ft near 4G4 airport at night reported sighting two lighted UAVs at his altitude so he climbed to 3;500 ft.,2016,07
187,201607,PENNSYLVANIA,VISUAL APPROACH TO UNV. RUNWAY 24. RIGHT HAND BASE LEG JUST INSIDE PENUE IAF. RECEIVED 'TOO LOW; TERRAIN' AND ONE 'PULL UP' GPWS WARNING. WE WERE VFR AND WERE BOTH AWARE OF TERRAIN IN AREA. NEITHER OF US FELT THAT WE WERE IN A UAS (UNDESIRED AIRCRAFT STATE) BEFORE; DURING; AND AFTER THE EVENT. WE WERE BETWEEN 4000 - 3000 FT MSL WHEN CROSSING THE RIDGE. EVEN THOUGH IT APPEARED VISUALLY; TO US BOTH; THAT WE WERE A SAFE HEIGHT ABOVE ANY TERRAIN; I LEVELED OFF MOMENTARILY AT 3100 FT UNTIL THE WARNINGS CEASED. POST FLIGHT I DOUBLE CHECKED THE APPROACH PLATE AND THE HIGHEST OBSTACLE IN THE AREA THAT WE OPERATED IN. THERE WAS ONE AT 1655 FT AND ANOTHER SOUTH OF US AT 2026 FT.,Air carrier Captain reported receiving a GPWS terrain warning on a visual approach to UNV airport.,2016,07
188,201607,SOUTH CAROLINA,WHILE CONDUCTING A UAV MAPPING FLIGHT OF RUNWAY 4 AT FDW THE UAV WAS NEARING END OF MISSION WHEN THE LOW BATTERY INDICATION WAS NOTED. DURING APPROACH TO LANDING A BEECHCRAFT BONANZA ANNOUNCED DEPARTURE FROM RUNWAY 22. EVASIVE ACTIONS WERE TAKEN TO DESCEND FROM 900 FEET MSL TO GET THE UAV ON THE GROUND ASAP. THE DEPARTING BONANZA HELD THE AIRCRAFT LOW WHILE DEPARTING. CTAF CALLS WERE MADE TO THE DEPARTING AIRCRAFT OF POSITION AND ALTITUDE OF THE UAV BUT RECEIVED NO RESPONSE. UAV AIRCRAFT WAS RECOVERED WITHOUT INCIDENT.,UAV pilot conducting a mapping flight of FDW Runway 4 reported a low battery light and a quick return to Runway 4 using CTAF procedures with a hand held VHF radio. A Bonanza announced departing Runway 22; but does not acknowledge the UAV pilot. Evasive action was taken by the UAV pilot.,2016,07
189,201607,SOUTH DAKOTA,FSD WAS LANDING RUNWAY 21; WE WERE SET UP FOR RUNWAY 21 BUT ALSO REQUESTED RUNWAY 03 TO FACILITATE OUR ARRIVAL. WE ALSO REQUESTED DIRECT TO CFBXM TO GIVE US A LONGER FINAL TO RUNWAY 03; AND IT WAS GRANTED. SHORTLY AFTERWARDS ATC ASKED US IF WE HAD THE FIELD IN SIGHT; AND WE REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. ATC RESPONDED; 'YOU ARE CLEARED THE VISUAL TO RUNWAY 03; MAINTAIN 2000 FEET.' I READ BACK THE CLEARANCE; AND SELECTED 2000 FEET IN THE MCP ALTIMETER. THE F/O (PF) FOLLOWED THE FMC GROUND TRACK & DESCENDED TO 2000 FEET. AT SOME POINT NEARING FINAL HE COMMENTED; 'I DON'T HAVE THE LOCALIZER; OH; WE HAVE THE LOCALIZER IN FOR 21.' I CHANGED THE FREQUENCY TO THE CORRECT ONE; AND WE TRACKED INBOUND ON FIRST THE FMS COURSE & THEN THE LOC. BY THIS POINT WE HAD REACHED 2000 FEET MSL & I REALIZED WE WERE CLOSE TO THE GROUND. I LOOKED OUT AHEAD & REASSURED MYSELF THAT WE WERE CLEAR OF TERRAIN. THE F/O THEN MADE THE COMMENT; 'THIS SEEMS TOO LOW.' WHILE I WISHED HE WOULD HAVE DISENGAGED THE AUTOPILOT & CLIMBED HIGHER; I WAS CONFIDENT THAT WE HAD OBSTRUCTION CLEARANCE [THE RADAR ALTIMETER AT THIS TIME READ APPROXIMATELY 1100 FEET]. AS HE WAS ABOUT TO CONFIGURE WITH LANDING GEAR WE RECEIVED A GPWS WARNING OF 'L/G NOT DOWN.' I GLANCED AT THE RADAR ALTIMETER AND IT INDICATED 800 FEET AGL. AGAIN I WAS CONFIDENT OF TERRAIN CLEARANCE & HAD THE RUNWAY IN SIGHT; SO I ELECTED TO ALLOW HIM TO CONTINUE. WE THEN FINISHED NORMAL CONFIGURATION; INTERCEPTED THE GLIDE PATH; AND THE LANDING WAS UNEVENTFUL. WE WERE DISTRACTED BY TWO ITEMS CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT ENVIRONMENT. THE FIRST WAS THE RUNWAY CHANGE FROM 21 TO 03; AND THE SECOND WAS A BALLOON LAUNCH CLOSE TO THE AIRFIELD. WHILE WE BRIEFED THE POSSIBILITY OF A RUNWAY CHANGE WHICH WOULD EXPEDITE OUR ARRIVAL; AS THE PNF I FORGOT TO CHANGE THE LOCALIZER FREQUENCY TO AID THE PF. THE BALLOON LAUNCH ALSO OCCUPIED QUITE A BIT OF MY OUTSIDE SCAN; SINCE THEY REPORTED ON APPROACH FREQUENCY THAT THERE WERE FOUR BALLOONS AND I ONLY SPOTTED TWO. THE FACT THAT ATC CLEARED US TO AN ALTITUDE FOR THE ARRIVAL WHICH WAS MUCH LOWER THAN NORMAL DID NOT REGISTER BECAUSE I WAS DISTRACTED BY OTHER CONDITIONS. AS THE CAPTAIN I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE AGGRESSIVE IN INSISTING THE F/O CLIMB UP TO A MORE REASONABLE ALTITUDE ONCE I REALIZED THAT ATC HAD ASSIGNED US ONE IN ERROR.,Air carrier Captain reported an EGPWS 'LANDING GEAR NOT DOWN' warning during visual approach to FSD after ATC cleared the aircraft too low and the crew was distracted by a balloon launch event.,2016,07
190,201607,TEXAS,I WAS TRAINING A TRAINEE ON RADAR WEST. IT WAS BUSY AND WE HAD MULTIPLE VFR AND IFR POP UPS DEPARTING SATELLITE AIRPORTS AS WELL AS VFR TAGS FLYING AROUND THAT WEREN'T TALKING TO ANYONE. AIRCRAFT Y CALLED UP ALREADY AIRBORNE OFF OF RYW AIRPORT AND AT THE TIME THE RADAR TRAINEE WAS TYPING IN A VFR POP UP AS WELL AS MULTIPLE INBOUNDS TO AUSTIN AND DEPARTURES WERE HAPPENING. THE DEVELOPMENTAL WORKING RADAR WEST WAS BUSY TALKING TO OTHER AIRCRAFT AND DID NOT RESPOND TO THE AIRCRAFT Y AND KEPT WORKING THE TRAFFIC THAT WAS ON THE RADAR. HE SHIPPED AIRCRAFT X TO THE FINALS CONTROLLER AS HE WAS DESCENDING ON THE ARRIVAL THROUGH 6500 FEET AND KEPT WORKING HIS OTHER TRAFFIC. THE FINALS CONTROLLER STARTED TALKING TO AIRCRAFT X AND THEN SAW UNIDENTIFIED VFR TRAFFIC WAS BELOW HIM FLYING EASTBOUND AT 5500 FEET AUSTIN FINALS 12 MILES NORTH OF THE AIRPORT. THE FINALS CONTROLLER ISSUED TRAFFIC AND A TURN TO AIRCRAFT Y. AIRCRAFT Y TURNED AND CLIMBED TO AVOID THE TRAFFIC AND THEN DECLARED A NEAR MIDAIR. WITH CLASS CHARLIE AIRSPACE AND NOT A CLASS BRAVO THERE IS REALLY NO AIRSPACE PROCEDURE THAT CAN CHANGE AIRCRAFT DEPARTING SATELLITE AIRPORTS NOT TALKING TO ANYONE AND FLYING ACROSS THE FINAL INTO AUSTIN AT DETRIMENTAL ALTITUDES BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT HAPPENS ALL TOO OFTEN. AND WITHOUT A CLASS BRAVO THERE IS NO WAY TO TELL A PILOT THAT HE CANNOT FLY 8 MILES NORTH AT 3000 FEET OF AN INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT ON THE FINAL WITH AIRLINERS DESCENDING IN TO THE AIRPORT TO LAND. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY INSTANCES OF AIRLINERS HAVING TO STAY HIGH OR DO EVASIVE MANEUVERS TO AVOID PILOTS THAT JUST FLY AROUND AND DO WHAT THEY WANT.,AUS TRACON trainee reported a VFR aircraft was attempting to contact them for service; but they were too busy to acknowledge the aircraft. The aircraft climbed into an aircraft on approach. The Final Controller had to vector and climb the aircraft on approach off their course to avoid the VFR traffic.,2016,07
191,201608,CALIFORNIA,FIRST OFF I WAS RETURNING FROM A DUTY FAM AND OFF WORK FOR THE PREVIOUS 5 DAYS. I HAD NOTICED ON MY SCOPE ON THE NW SIDE OF MY BOUNDARY AND EAST SIDE OF MY BOUNDARY TWO INTRUDER CODES OF 4453 UP VERY HIGH. I HAD TO ASK SOMEONE ABOUT THEM AND THEY SAID THEY WERE BALLOONS. I HAD NO PREVIOUS INFORMATION OR KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THEM. I HAD NO IDEA THAT ONE OF THEM WOULD SOON MAKE AN IMPACT ON MY DECISION MAKING AND ASSUMED THEY WERE STAYING ABOVE MY TRAFFIC. I NEVER GAVE THOUGHT TO THEM COMING DOWN OR MOVING INTO THE PATH OF ONE OF MY AIRCRAFT.MY SUPERVISOR POINTED TOWARDS THE NORTH WEST PART OF MY SCOPE TO THE 4453 AT FL530 OR THEREABOUTS. HE SAID; 'THEY ARE GOING TO RELEASE THE BALLOON AND KEEP AN EYE ON IT'. I INQUIRED WHAT THAT MEANT AND HE SAID DROP IT AND TO KEEP AN EYE ON IT. SO; I CONTINUED WORKING STEADY TRAFFIC GLANCING TOWARDS THE CODE AND NOT NOTICING ANYTHING. A FLIGHT CHECKED ON AT FL350 AS I BECAME DISTRACTED ON THE EAST SIDE OF MY SECTOR AND HAD TO ASK WHO CALLED AGAIN. THE INTRUDER HAD DROPPED ON MY EASTERN 4453. I CALLED TRAFFIC TO [TWO] FLIGHTS. I BELIEVE RIGHT AFTER THAT CONFLICT ALERT ACTIVATED WITH AIRCRAFT X AND THE INTRUDER. I DIDN'T KNOW THE RATE OF DESCENT; EVEN THE DIRECTION; BUT IT APPEARED IN 1 MINUTE THE AIRCRAFT WOULD FLY RIGHT INTO THE PATH OF THE BALLOON. I DIDN'T KNOW REALLY WHAT TO SAY OR DO EXCEPT TELL THE AIRCRAFT X TO TURN FOR AN AVOIDANCE VECTOR AND TRIED TO EXPLAIN WHAT WAS GOING ON. I WAS SO SHOCKED THAT IN MY 29 YEARS PLUS IN THE AGENCY I AM VECTORING AN AIRCRAFT FOR SOMETHING I DON'T KNOW ABOUT OR HAD ANY KIND OF BRIEFING. I HAD TO GO ON THE INTERNET TO READ ABOUT THE PROJECT AND REALIZE THE PAYLOAD IS ABOUT 50 POUNDS WHILE THE BALLOON WEIGHS ABOUT 250 POUNDS. THIS IS NOT SOMETHING A JET WANTS TO HIT AT 440 MPH OR TAKE AN EVASIVE RA AT THE LAST SECOND POSSIBLY INJURING PEOPLE IN THE BACK OF THE PLANE.THERE NEEDS TO BE AN IMMEDIATE RESPONSE FROM THE FAA. 1ST OFF; I LEARNED TODAY THERE WERE 10 DIFFERENT BALLOONS IN OUR AIRSPACE AND THEY ALL ARE SQUAWKING 4453. THIS NEEDS TO BE CHANGED IMMEDIATELY TO CODES OF 4453 TO 4463 FOR EXAMPLE. WHEN A CIC OR SUPERVISOR WALKS UP TO SAY A BALLOON IS RELEASING THERE NEEDS TO BE NO CONFUSION WHICH TARGET IS STARTING DOWN. SECONDLY; THE WORKFORCE NEEDS A BRIEFING ON THESE BALLOONS; THERE APPROXIMATE DESCENT RATE; COLOR; SIZE AT ALTITUDE; ETC. SO WE CAN DESCRIBE IT AND OBVIOUSLY ANTICIPATE WHAT NEEDS TO BE SAID TO AN AIRCRAFT IN THE PATH IF IT IS RELEASED TOWARDS THE EARTH. AND FINALLY; HERE ARE SOME OF THE LATEST INCIDENTS BELOW THAT I FOUND. DO ANY OF US AS CONTROLLERS OR THE AGENCY WANT IT TO INCLUDE AN INCIDENT WITH AN AIRCRAFT? I THINK NOT. OUR NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECT TO RANDOM CHANCE WITHOUT CONTROLLER BRIEFINGS!,ZOA Controller reported of a balloon descending in his airspace and having to issue traffic on the balloon to other aircraft. Controller was not briefed on the balloon's mission prior to working the position.,2016,08
192,201608,COLORADO,I WAS ON LOCAL; GROUND CONTROL WAS COMBINED WITH CONTROLLER IN CHARGE AND FLIGHT DATA; ONE CPC WAS ON BREAK; FLM WAS IN THE OFFICE. RUNWAYS 30 WHERE IN USE; WIND CALM. GROUND ASKED IF I COULD TAKE AN ODO (OPPOSITE DIRECTION OPERATION) FOR A VFR. I SAID YES. TRAFFIC WAS LIGHT AT THE TIME AND I ONLY HAD ONE IN THE PATTERN (AIRCRAFT X) ON RUNWAY 30L. I THOUGHT THE AIRCRAFT (AIRCRAFT Y) ASKED FOR RUNWAY 12L. AFTER LISTENING TO THE TAPES; GROUND ASKED THE PILOT IF HE WANTED RUNWAY 12L. SHORTLY AFTER AIRCRAFT Y WAS TAXIING OUT HE TAXIED ABOUT 8 AIRCRAFT. AIRCRAFT Z JOINED THE PATTERN FROM THE SOUTH FOR RUNWAY 30L. WHEN AIRCRAFT Y WAS READY AIRCRAFT X WAS CHANGED TO RUNWAY 30R IN THE PATTERN. AIRCRAFT A CALLED FROM THE NORTH AND WAS TO ENTER A MIDFIELD RIGHT DOWNWIND RUNWAY 30R. AIRCRAFT B CALLED FROM THE NORTH AND WAS ALSO TOLD TO ENTER A MIDFIELD RIGHT DOWNWIND. THIS AIRCRAFT WAS FOLLOWING AIRCRAFT A. AT RUNWAY 30R I HAD JUST DEPARTED 3 AIRCRAFT AND HAD TWO WAITING. I TOLD AIRCRAFT X TO MAKE A LEFT 360; TO EXTEND DOWNWIND; AND TOLD ABOUT THE ODO AIRCRAFT. AIRCRAFT A WAS TOLD TO FOLLOW AIRCRAFT X WHO WAS MAKING THE 360. THREE AIRCRAFT WERE DEPARTED 30R BEFORE AIRCRAFT X DID THE 360. AIRCRAFT Y WAS TOLD ABOUT AIRCRAFT X ON DOWNWIND AND CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF. AIRCRAFT Z WAS TOLD TO MAKE A RIGHT 360 SO I COULD TURN AIRCRAFT Y OF THE FINAL FOR 30R. I TURNED AIRCRAFT Y RIGHT 20 DEGREES; GAVE AIRCRAFT X THE BASE TURN AND CLEARED AIRCRAFT X TO LAND 30R. I TOLD AIRCRAFT Z ABOUT AIRCRAFT Y. AIRCRAFT Z DID NOT HAVE HIM IN SIGHT. I TOLD AIRCRAFT Z TO MAKE A LEFT 360 TO AVOID AIRCRAFT Y BECAUSE HE WAS ABOUT TURN PAST THE DOWNWIND INTO AIRCRAFT Y. AIRCRAFT Z SAID HE HAD AIRCRAFT Y IN SIGHT AND WHERE ABOUT A HALF MILE OR MORE APART. AIRCRAFT Z SAID HE WOULD 'TUCK IN BEHIND' THE AIRCRAFT. I THEN CLEARED AIRCRAFT Z TO LAND ON 30L. I WENT BACK TO MY SCAN FOR THE REST OF THE AIRCRAFT. AIRCRAFT Z LOOKED LIKE HE WAS TURNING BASE FOR 30L AND AIRCRAFT X WAS ON FINAL FOR 30R. AIRCRAFT X THEN SAID HE WAS GOING AROUND DUE TO A NEAR MISS WITH AIRCRAFT Z WHO LINED UP FOR 30R. AIRCRAFT Z WAS HIGHER THAN AIRCRAFT X SO I SENT AIRCRAFT Z AROUND ALSO. AIRCRAFT X HAD TO MANEUVER TO MISS AIRCRAFT Z AND SAID HE HAD TO GET DOWN. AIRCRAFT Z WAS PUT BACK IN LEFT TRAFFIC AND TOLD TO EXTEND DOWNWIND. I HAD TO COORDINATE WITH D01 BECAUSE AN IFR WAS NOT AIRBORNE WITHIN 3 MINUTES OF GETTING THE RELEASE. AIRCRAFT A WAS SHORT FINAL RUNWAY 30L AND AIRCRAFT B WAS CHANGED TO RWY 30L EARLIER AND WAS ABOUT A 3.5 MILE RIGHT BASE. I TOLD AIRCRAFT B TO TURN TO THE FINAL AS HE WAS ABOUT TO FLY THROUGH IT. AIRCRAFT X LANDED RUNWAY 30R AND EXITED TOLD TO CALL THE TOWER WHEN IN PARKING. AIRCRAFT Z THEN TURNED BASE ON HIS OWN IN FRONT OF AIRCRAFT B. AIRCRAFT Z WAS ABOUT .5-.75 MILES IN FRONT. I TOLD HIM TO TURN BACK TO THE DOWNWIND SINCE AIRCRAFT B WAS QUICKLY CLOSING IN ON AIRCRAFT Z. WHEN AIRCRAFT Z CROSSES IN FRONT OF AIRCRAFT B HE WAS ABOUT .25 MILES IN FRONT. AIRCRAFT Z SAID HE WAS HAVING TROUBLE HEARING ME. HE THEN FLEW SOUTHEAST BOUND. AIRCRAFT Z WAS TOLD TO TURN BACK TO THE BASE AS HE WAS 3.5 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE AIRPORT. I CLEARED AIRCRAFT Z TO LAND 30L AND HE READ IT BACK. AIRCRAFT C WAS TO JOIN FINAL FOR 30L; CHANGED TO 30R; GIVEN TRAFFIC TO AIRCRAFT Z; HE GOT AIRCRAFT Z IN SIGHT; CLEARED TO LAND 30R. AIRCRAFT Z LANDED RUNWAY 30L; TURNED RIGHT ON G; GIVEN HOLD SHORT INSTRUCTIONS; HE READ BACK THE HOLD SHORT; WHEN TOLD TO CROSS 30R HE SAID SAY AGAIN; THIS HAPPENED TWICE. I WAS RELIEVED FROM POSITION.THE WHOLE TIME I HAD ZERO HELP FROM THE CIC/GROUND CONTROLLER. HE STATED HE HAD GROUND TRAFFIC WHICH I DO NOT FEEL HE HAD ENOUGH TO NOT HELP WITH THE SITUATION. HE DID NOT SEE EITHER TIME AIRCRAFT Z TURNED INTO AIRCRAFT. HE DID NOT CALL UP HELP UNTIL I SAID I NEED TO GET OUT OF POSITION. IT STILL TOOK 10-15 MINUTES BEFORE ANYONE GOT UP THERE. HE CALLED FLM AND SAID WE NEEDED HELP BUT GAVE NO URGENCY TO IT. WHEN AIRCRAFT Z WAS ON FINAL THE LAST TIME REPORTED A DRONE UNDERHIM.RECOMMENDATIONS:1) FLM BE IN THE TOWER MORE AND IN THE HOURS OF 7-5.2) CONTROLLERS NOT SUGGEST ODO OPERATIONS.3) PILOTS BE EDUCATED WHEN OPERATING WITH PARALLEL OPERATIONS.4) GROUND BE EDUCATED ABOUT HOW THEY CONTRIBUTED TO THE SITUATION.,BJC Local Controller and an instructor pilot reported a near miss while on final. The offending aircraft lined up for the wrong runway which put it into conflict with the instructor's aircraft.,2016,08
193,201608,ILLINOIS,WHILE ENROUTE IN CRUISE FLIGHT ON MY NORMAL ROUTE FOR TRAFFIC WATCH; I ENCOUNTERED ANOTHER AIRCRAFT OVER THE LOCATION NOTED. I NOTICED THE AIRCRAFT AS IT APPEARED APPROXIMATELY 100FT AHEAD; DIRECTLY 12 O'CLOCK TO MY AIRCRAFT'S NOSE; FLYING HEAD ON AT MY AIRCRAFT. IMMEDIATELY I BANKED MY AIRCRAFT TO THE RIGHT; AND THE OTHER AIRCRAFT BANKED TO ITS RIGHT. THE AIRCRAFT WAS AT THE SAME ALTITUDE; 1;700 FT. THE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT A MANNED AIRCRAFT; POSSIBLY A HEAVY DUTY REMOTE CONTROL AIRPLANE OR A UAV. IT WAS RED AND WHITE; AND LOOKED SIMILAR TO A GLIDER BUT MUCH SMALLER. IT DID NOT APPEAR ON MY ADS-B RECEIVER. TO MY KNOWLEDGE; IT IS NOT LEGAL TO FLY AN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT AT THE ALTITUDE I WAS AT; WHICH ENDANGERED THE SAFETY OF MY FLIGHT AND PASSENGER; AS WELL AS SCARING MY PASSENGER. THE AIRCRAFT HAD NO ANTI-COLLISION LIGHT OPERATING AND WAS DIFFICULT TO SEE UNTIL IT WAS VERY CLOSE. I AM UNSURE IF THERE ARE ANY MEANS OF FINDING THE OPERATOR OF THIS AIRCRAFT; BUT I FELT IT NECESSARY TO REPORT AS THE AIRCRAFT IS OPERATING POSSIBLY ILLEGALLY AND MAY POTENTIALLY CAUSE MORE INCIDENTS IN THE FUTURE WITH OTHER AIRCRAFT.,A small aircraft pilot reported a close encounter with a UAV. He took immediate evasive action and avoided a collision with the UAV.,2016,08
194,201609,CALIFORNIA,WHILE DEPARTING FROM HMT RUNWAY 23; MY STUDENT NOTICED AN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT; THAT APPEARED TO BE A RECREATIONAL USE RC AIRCRAFT OPERATING IN THE AREA ABOUT 1.7 MILES SOUTHWEST OF HMT. THERE APPEARED TO BE A MINIATURIZED RUNWAY CONSTRUCTED OF CONCRETE ON THE GROUND WITH MULTIPLE RC AIRCRAFT ON THE GROUND. THE UAS APPEARED TO BE OPERATING ABOUT 100 FEET BELOW US; AND ABOUT 2000 FEET LATERALLY TO OUR LEFT. THIS WOULD PUT THE AIRCRAFT AT ABOUT 500-600 FEET AGL. THE AIRCRAFT DID NOT POSE AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO US; HOWEVER THE AIRCRAFT AND THE FIELD IT APPEARED TO BE OPERATING FROM ARE LOCATED IN THE FLIGHT PATH NORMALLY USED BY PILOTS PERFORMING A 45 DEGREE ENTRY TO THE LEFT DOWNWIND OF RUNWAY 23. THERE WERE NO NOTICES ON THE AIRPORT ASOS OR OVER ANY OTHER FREQUENCIES.,PA28 instructor pilot reported that a miniature airport for model aircraft is located 1.7 NM SW of the HMT airport and one of the aircraft came in conflict with them nearby the RC strip.,2016,09
195,201609,FLORIDA,ON THE MONROE APPROACH INTO SFB; STUDENT SAW SOMETHING THAT LOOK[ED] TO BE A BLACK DOT FLOATING IN THE AIR FROM THE RIGHT OF THE WING OF THE AIRCRAFT. INSTRUCTOR PILOT (IP) SCANNED THE AREA TO VERIFY INFORMATION FROM THE STUDENT; IP IDENTIFIED THE BLACK DOT TO BE A DRONE/QUAD-HELICOPTER FLOATING IN MID-AIR AROUND 1500-1600 FT ON THE MONROE ARRIVAL PATH. IP TOOK ACTION AND AVOIDED THE DRONE (STATIONARY) AND REPORTED TO ORLANDO APP FOR THE DRONE. ORLANDO APP ASKED FOR A BRIEF DESCRIPTION AND INFORMATION WAS GIVEN TO THE BEST OF THE ABILITY AT THE TIME. NO FURTHER INCIDENT OCCURRED AFTERWARDS. SWITCHED OVER TO TOWER AND CONTINUED FOR CLOSED TRAFFIC. INCIDENT WAS WRITTEN UP FOR SAFETY AFTER THE FLIGHT.,C172 instructor pilot reported sighting a drone at 1600 feet during arrival to SFB. Evasive action was taken.,2016,09
196,201609,ILLINOIS,JUST DEPARTED RUNWAY 22L AT MDW. ENCOUNTERED A NEAR MISS WITH A UAS THAT WAS WHITE WITH RED STRIPES. I COULD NOT TELL IF IT WAS A QUADCOPTER OR WHAT. IT HAPPENED SO QUICK. WE SAW IT AND IT DISAPPEARED UNDER THE AIRCRAFT. IT WAS RIGHT IN FRONT OF AIRCRAFT AND BELOW. I WAS JUST GOING THRU 1000 MSL (400 AGL); CLEARED TO 3000 FROM ATC. WE INFORMED MIDWAY TOWER OF WHAT WE ENCOUNTERED.,CE550 Captain experienced a NMAC with a UAV while departing MDW Runway 22L at 400 feet AGL.,2016,09
197,201609,ILLINOIS,OUR AIRCRAFT DEPARTED ORD RUNWAY 9R BEHIND SEVERAL LARGE TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT. THERE WAS A B787; TWO B737S; THEN OUR FLIGHT. ALL FLIGHTS WERE SPENDING MINIMUM TIME ON THE RUNWAY PRIOR TO DEPARTURE. OUR AIRPLANE CLIMBED TO FRA (FLAP RETRACTION ALTITUDE) WITH ALT-T/O-1 (REDUCED) POWER AND THE AIRPLANE WAS RECONFIGURED FOR THE ORD 2 DEPARTURE PROFILE. AT APPROXIMATELY 1;600 FT AGL; THE PF NOTED THE PLI (PITCH LIMIT INDICATOR) DISPLAYED AND RAPIDLY APPROACHING THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR. THE PF WAS HAND-FLYING AND REDUCED THE PITCH TO APPROXIMATELY 8 DEGREES NOSE UP. THE AIRSPEED WAS SLOWLY ACCELERATING THROUGH 170 KNOTS WITH A WINGS-LEVEL; 'RUNWAY HEADING' STRAIGHT CLIMBOUT ASSIGNED. THE PLI CONTINUED TO DESCEND INTO THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR AND WAS OBSERVED TO TURN RED FOLLOWED BY A MOMENTARY (1 SEC) STICK SHAKER ACTUATION. THE WAKE FROM THE PRECEDING AIRCRAFT WAS OBVIOUSLY FELT AS THE PF CONTINUED TO LOWER THE PITCH TO APPROXIMATELY 3 DEGREES NOSE UP AS WE CONTINUED TO ACCELERATE THROUGH THE WAKE TURBULENCE. AS FAST AS THE PLI APPEARED; IT VANISHED AS WE CONTINUED TO CLIMB AND ACCELERATE. APPROXIMATELY 8-10 SECONDS LATER ACCELERATING THROUGH 184 KNOTS AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 1;900 FT AGL; THE PLI AGAIN REAPPEARED ONCE AGAIN AND DESCENDED INTO THE FLIGHT DIRECTOR; TURNING RED; AND CAUSING THE STICK SHAKER TO ACTIVATE BRIEFLY ONCE AGAIN FOR ABOUT .5 SECONDS. OUR AIRCRAFT COULD BE FELT TO HAVE ENTERED AND EXITED BOTH BURBLES OF WAKE TURBULENCE AS WE CONTINUED OUR CLIMB AND ACCELERATION TO 240 KNOTS. TOTAL PITCH ATTITUDE NEVER EXCEEDED A REASONABLE CLIMB ATTITUDE (-0 DEG AND +8 DEG) DURING THE WAKE ENCOUNTER. TOTAL BANK ANGLE NEVER EXCEEDED AN ESTIMATED 20 DEGREES EITHER LEFT OR RIGHT. OUR AIRCRAFT CONTINUED A NORMAL CLIMBOUT AFTERWARDS AND PROCEEDED TO OUR LANDING DESTINATION WITH NO FURTHER EVENTS. THE BIGGEST THREAT WE FACED WAS AN ASSUMED 'TIME PRESSURE' WITH ATC WHILE BEING CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF BEHIND A SUCCESSIVE LINEUP OF ONE HEAVY AND TWO VERY LARGE AIRCRAFT BEFORE OUR TAKEOFF. WE WERE GIVEN WAKE TURBULENCE CAUTION UPON RECEIVING OUR TAKEOFF CLEARANCE. WE UNDERESTIMATED THE WAKE BECAUSE ALL PREVIOUS THREE DEPARTURES WERE STRAIGHT OUT KEEPING THE WAKE OVER THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY WITH A 4 KNOT QUARTERING TAILWIND OBSERVED WHEN BEGINNING OUR TAKEOFF ROLL. ANOTHER THREAT WAS THAT ALL DEPARTURES WERE HAVING THE SAME 'RUNWAY HEADING' INSTRUCTIONS ON DEPARTURE. AN ERROR MADE BY THE PF WAS THE UNDERESTIMATION OF THE LINGERING EFFECTS OF THIS WAKE PHENOMENON OVER THE EXTENDED RUNWAY CENTERLINE. ALSO; 'MAX THRUST' WAS NOT CALLED FOR BY THE PF SINCE THE PLI APPEARED AND DISAPPEARED VERY QUICKLY FROM THE PFD SUGGESTING THAT IT WOULD BE A BRIEF ENCOUNTER WITH POSSIBLE WAKE AND THAT AN AGGRESSIVE THRUST CHANGE WOULD NOT BE NECESSARY. THE PF FELT THAT THE STEEP PITCH ANGLE OF THE ORD 2 DEPARTURE COULD BE SACRIFICED INSTEAD OF ADDING EXCESS THRUST SINCE WE HAD ALREADY ACHIEVED FRA AND THE AIRPLANE WAS CONFIGURED FOR FLAPS 0 AND ACCELERATING ALREADY IN A WINGS-LEVEL (MAXIMUM LIFT PRODUCTION) ATTITUDE. ANOTHER THREAT NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS EVENT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE USE OF AUTOPILOT IMMEDIATELY AFTER DEPARTURE. IT WOULD HAVE DEFINITELY CAUSED AN UPSET AND A MORE SIGNIFICANT ROLL/PITCH DILEMMA IF THE PILOT WAS NOT ACTIVELY RECEIVING FEEDBACK THROUGH THE CONTROL COLUMN. BOTH PF AND PM DISCOVERED THIS CONCEPT THROUGH EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION DURING THE WAKE TURBULENCE EVENT AND RECOVERY. THE PF WAS GLAD TO HAVE BEEN HAND-FLYING WHEN THIS EVENT OCCURRED TO BE ABLE TO TAKE IMMEDIATE ACTION AND RESPOND WITH DELIBERATE CONTROL INPUTS TO KEEP THE AIRPLANE FROM BECOMING A UAS. ALSO; SMOOTH RUDDER INPUT PREVENTED ANY UNNECESSARY YAW/ROLL AT THE SLOWER CLIMBOUT SPEED.ADOPTING STANDARD SEPARATION MINIMA AND STICKING WITH THAT SHOULD BE A PRIORITY OF ATC. DEFINED DISTANCES; RATHER THAN IMPLIED; SHOULD BE MANDATED FOR KEEPING DANGEROUS WAKE TURBULENCE EVENTS TO A MINIMUM. ALSO; WHEN GIVEN A TAKEOFF CLEARANCE; DO NOT RUSH THE DEPARTURE! WAIT A FEW SECONDS TO WATCH THE PRECEDING AIRPLANE AND ITS FLIGHT PATH TO SEE AND EVALUATE WHERE IT GOES! CONSIDER BRIEFING THE INPUT OF MAX THRUST WHEN A POSSIBLE WAKE TURBULENCE ENCOUNTER MAY EXIST! IT'S BETTER TO HAVE THE EXTRA THRUST ALREADY TO PRECLUDE A SECONDARY SHAKER ACTIVATION. ALSO; DO NOT USE THE AUTOPILOT IF/WHEN CLOSE SEPARATION BETWEEN DEPARTURES COULD POSE A WAKE TURBULENCE THREAT. ALWAYS HAND FLY UP TO FRA SO EFFECTIVE CONTROL FEEDBACK CAN BE FELT THROUGH THE CONTROL COLUMN GIVING THE PF THE MOST ACCURATE INFORMATION POSSIBLE NECESSARY TO THWART A WAKE TURBULENCE/WINDSHEAR ENCOUNTER!,EMB-145LR Captain reported a brief stick shaker resulted from a wake turbulence encounter departing ORD.,2016,09
198,201609,ILLINOIS,ON APPROACH TO 28C AT ORD. CLEARED FOR THE APPROACH AT 4000 FT OVER HAZIL. FIRST OFFICER WAS PILOT FLYING. JUST AS THE DESCENT WAS STARTED ON THE GLIDESLOPE OVER THE SHORELINE OF LAKE MICHIGAN; I SAW A DRONE BELOW AND TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE NOSE OF THE AIRPLANE PASS UNDERNEATH. MY BEST GUESS ON THE ALTITUDE IS 2000-3000 FT. IT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO MY AIRCRAFT THAT I COULD SEE 2 WHITE PROPELLERS ON THE TOP. THE BODY APPEARED TO BE ORANGE IN COLOR. IT WAS ONLY IN SIGHT FOR A COUPLE OF SECONDS BEFORE PASSING UNDERNEATH THE NOSE. I REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO ATC.,B777 Captain reported sighting a UAV about 1500 feet below his aircraft while on approach to ORD Runway 28C.,2016,09
199,201609,ILLINOIS,A BEACH BALL SIZED DRONE FLEW OVERHEAD TRAVELING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF OUR APPROACH COURSE. AT APPROXIMATELY 1 MILE PRIOR TO SEIKA; 28C FAF; AND 2400 MSL; A SILVER REFLECTIVE DRONE WAS SIGHTED ABOVE AND TO THE RIGHT OF OUR POSITION. IT WAS TRAVEL[ING] IN A ENE DIRECTION AT ABOUT 3000. IT WAS NEVER A CONFLICT TO OUR FLIGHT PATH. BOTH APPROACH CONTROL AND ORD TOWER WERE ADVISED AT THE TIME OF THE SIGHTING.,A319 Captain on approach to ORD Runway 28C at 2;400 feet reported a UAV at 3;000 feet one mile prior to SEIKA.,2016,09
200,201609,MICHIGAN,I WAS LEVEL IN CRUISE FLIGHT; SOUTH/SOUTHEAST BOUND AT 7;400 (SLIGHTLY OFF MY DESIRED ALTITUDE OF 7;500) RECEIVING BASIC RADAR SERVICE FROM ATCT/TRACON. WHILE LOOKING OUTSIDE MY LEFT WINDOW; I NOTICED A DRONE/UAV JUST BELOW MY ALTITUDE BY APPROXIMATELY 300 FEET AND LESS THAN 500 FEET AWAY HORIZONTALLY. IT WAS MOVING DUE NORTHBOUND. THE DRONE APPEARED TO BE SHAPED LIKE A LONG DUMBBELL IN A VERTICAL ORIENTATION; WITH A MOTOR OF SOME SORT ON THE TOP PROPELLING IT FORWARD; DRAGGING A LOWER SECTION (PERHAPS A CAMERA) THAT WAS CONNECTED TO A CABLE OF SOME SORT. THE DRONE WAS SILVER IN COLOR (POSSIBLY WHITE AND JUST REFLECTING BRIGHTLY FROM THE SUN BEGINNING TO SET IN THE WEST); APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET LONG (TOP TO BOTTOM); AND VERY NARROW IN WIDTH. I HAVE EXPERIENCED SEEING WEATHER BALLOONS BEFORE; BUT THIS DID NOT APPEAR TO BE ONE; AND THIS WAS TO MY KNOWLEDGE NOT A WEATHER BALLOON LAUNCH AREA. THE TOP PORTION OF THIS DRONE WAS NOT INFLATED AND DID NOT APPEAR INFLATABLE. I NOTIFIED ATC AS SOON AS THE DRONE WAS SPOTTED.I WAS QUITE SURPRISED AT THE POTENTIAL THIS ENCOUNTER HAD FOR BECOMING A MIDAIR COLLISION. GIVEN MY AIRPLANE'S SMALL SIZE; THIS COULD HAVE EASILY CAUSED AN EMERGENCY HAD I BEEN JUST A HARE MORE TO THE EAST WHERE THIS DRONE WAS FLYING; AND JUST A TOUCH MORE OFF OF MY PREPLANNED ALTITUDE.,A C150 pilot at 7;400 ft reported a near miss with what appeared to be a camera carrying drone.,2016,09
201,201609,NEVADA,WHILE WAITING IN LINE FOR DEPARTURE; IT BECAME APPARENT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE EARLY MORNING PUSH FOR DEPARTURES INTERSPERSED WITH A STEADY STREAM OF ARRIVALS. RUNWAY 25R WAS IN USE FOR ARRIVALS/DEPARTURES ALONG WITH OPERATIONS BEING CONDUCTED FROM THE RUNWAY 19L/R COMPLEX. I CANNOT ADEQUATELY PROVIDE THE COLOR TO THE STORY EXCEPT TO SAY THAT THERE HAD BEEN A GO-AROUND FROM THE RUNWAY 19L/R COMPLEX AND A HOT AIR BALLOON THAT MADE MULTIPLE UNANSWERED CALLS TO THE LAS TOWER. EARLIER; [THE] BALLOON HAD CHECKED IN WITH LAS TOWER TO REPORT OPERATIONS SIX MILES WEST OF THE AIRPORT AT 4000 FEET. THE CONTROLLER EVENTUALLY DID ANSWER [THE] BALLOON; ADVISING [HIM] TO REMAIN CLEAR OF CLASS B AIRSPACE. BALLOON RESPONDED BY SAYING THEY WOULD BE OPERATING SIX MILES WEST OF THE AIRPORT AT 5000 FEET. THE CONTROLLER DID NOT ACKNOWLEDGE THE TRANSMISSION.  A B737 HAD BEEN CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF ON RUNWAY 25R. HOLDING SHORT OF 25R; LAS TOWER ASKED IF WE HAD THAT [B737] IN SIGHT. WE REPLIED THAT WE HAD THE [B737] IN SIGHT AS THE B737 WAS JUST BEGINNING ITS TAKEOFF ROLL. WE WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CLEARED TO LINE UP AND WAIT ON RUNWAY 25R. TAKING THE RUNWAY; WE WERE CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF BY THE TOWER. ALIGNING THE AIRPLANE ON THE RUNWAY; I NOTICED TWO THINGS. ONE; THE B737 WASN'T AIRBORNE YET; AND SECONDLY THERE WAS A FLIGHT OF TWO HOT AIR BALLOONS OPERATING WEST OF THE AIRPORT. I DELAYED OUR TAKEOFF ROLL; SINCE THE B737 WASN'T AIRBORNE. I ASKED THE FIRST OFFICER TO CONFIRM WE WERE CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF. THE FIRST OFFICER WAS INITIALLY UNABLE TO DO SO AS THE CONTROLLER HAD CLEARED THE AIRPLANE BEHIND US TO LINE UP AND WAIT. THE CONTROLLER CONFIRMED WE HAD BEEN CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF. WE BEGAN OUR TAKEOFF ROLL AS THE B737 BECAME AIRBORNE. DURING OUR TAKEOFF ROLL; THE TOWER ADVISED ARRIVING 25R TRAFFIC TO PREPARE FOR A GO-AROUND. FLYING THE COWBY6 RNAV DEPARTURE; AT 600 FEET AGL; WE ENCOUNTERED THE B737'S WAKE TURBULENCE. THE WAKE TURBULENCE CONTINUED UNTIL THE INITIAL TURN PASSING RBELL TO ROPPR INTERSECTION WITH THE WORST ROLLING MOMENT OF THE WAKE TURBULENCE OCCURRING DURING THAT TURN. THE WAKE TURBULENCE MADE FLYING THE LATERAL PORTION OF THE COWBY6 RNAV DEPARTURE DIFFICULT PARTICULARLY TURNING TOWARD ROPPR INTERSECTION SINCE THE TURN HAD BEEN BEGUN LATE DUE TO HAVING TO MANAGE THE WAKE TURBULENCE. KEEP IN MIND; THE FLIGHT OF TWO HOT-AIR BALLOONS OPERATING WEST OF THE AIRPORT.,B737 Captain reported a track deviation resulted departing LAS after encountering wake turbulence in trail of another B737.,2016,09
202,201609,NEW YORK,I HOLD TWO FAA RATINGS: PART 61 PRIVATE PILOT ASEL AND PART 107 REMOTE PILOT; SMALL UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM. I CAREFULLY RESEARCHED FLYING A SMALL UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM OVER NIAGARA FALLS WEEKS BEFORE THIS FLIGHT. PILOT SAFELY AND LEGALLY LAUNCHED; AND SUBSEQUENTLY LANDED; A DRONE (UAS) FROM THE NEW YORK STATE SIDE OF THE FALLS WITH MOST OF THE FLIGHT TAKING PLACE OVER THE AMERICAN FALLS; ALSO LOCATED ON THE NEW YORK STATE SIDE. WHILE IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAREFULLY PLANNED; AND SAFE; CONTROLLED FLIGHT OVER NIAGARA FALLS; PILOT FAILED TO RECOGNIZE THE EXACT PART OF THE AIRSPACE OVER THE HORSESHOE FALLS THAT IS ACTUALLY IN CANADIAN AIRSPACE. THIS WAS REALIZED AFTER THE FLIGHT WAS CONCLUDED AND VERIFIED WITH MAPPING ON THE DJI GO APP; WHICH RECORDS THE SEQUENCE OF FLIGHT.  ALSO; IT IS BELIEVED THE ALTITUDES INDICATED DURING FLIGHT WERE NOT ACCURATE EVEN AFTER THE UAS WAS PROPERLY CALIBRATED OVER A GRASS SURFACE. SOME OF THE RECORDED ALTITUDES INDICATE HIGHER THAN 400 AGL AND BELIEVE THIS MAY BE A COMPOSITE MEASUREMENT OF THE LAUNCH POINT ALTITUDE OF 614 FEET MSL AND THE DROP OFF OVER THE FALLS DESCENDING TO AS LOW AS 167 FEET BELOW THAT; INDICATING AN MSL ALTITUDE OF 447 FEET. IN THE FUTURE I SHALL ALSO CONTACT TRANSPORT CANADA BEFORE ANY FLIGHTS OVER THE HORSESHOE FALLS; EVEN IF THE FLIGHT BEGINS AND ENDS IN UNITED STATES AIRSPACE.,A UAS pilot realized after a flight over the Horseshoe Falls portion of Niagara Falls that he may have inadvertently flown into Canadian Airspace. Also; the UAS postflight altitude indicated greater than 400 ft because the 167 ft waterfall drop off made the aircraft appear higher than the preflight calibrated altitude.,2016,09
203,201609,VIRGINIA,I MISREAD THE DISTANCE FROM THE LOCATION OF MY HOBBYIST UAS TRAINING FLIGHT AND WAS ABOUT 4 MILES FROM HIGH VIEW AIRPORT; A PRIVATE; NON-TOWERED AIRPORT IN NORTHERN VIRGINIA; APPROXIMATELY 10 NM SOUTH OF MRB. I HAD TRIED TO CONTACT THE OWNER OF THE AIRPORT PREVIOUSLY IN ORDER TO DISCUSS CONTACTING HIM IF NEED BE AND NEVER RECEIVED A RESPONSE FROM HIM. THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO OTHER PRIVATE AIRPORTS IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF HIGH VIEW; BUT THEY ARE NOT CHARTED ON THE WASHINGTON SECTIONAL. THEY ARE ACTUALLY BUSIER THAN HIGH VIEW WHICH SEES VERY LITTLE ACTIVITY. NONE OF THE THREE HAVE MORE THAN 1 OR TWO FLIGHTS PER WEEK THAT I CAN TELL. I WENT BACK TO THE AREA I FLEW AND USED THE B4UFLY APP AND DISCOVERED MY MEASUREMENT ERROR.THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE A GOOD WAY TO FIND CONTACT INFORMATION FOR PRIVATE AIRPORTS. NONE APPEAR IN THE FAA'S CHART SUPPLEMENT BOOK (FORMERLY AIRPORT FACILITY DIRECTORY) AND I CANNOT FIND CONTACT INFO ON WEB BASED PROGRAMS LIKE FOREFLIGHT. IF THE FAA IS GOING TO REQUIRE NOTIFICATION OF PRIVATE AIRPORTS (AS THIS SHOWED UP ON B4UFLY); WE NEED A SOURCE OF CONTACT INFORMATION. I JUST HAPPENED TO KNOW THE OWNER OF HIGH VIEW AND AS STATED BEFORE HAD TRIED UNSUCCESSFULLY TO CONTACT HIM.,UAV pilot discovered after the fact that he flew within 4 NM of a private airport. He believes that if the FAA is going to require notification to private airports a source of contact information needs to be available. There does not seem to be a good way to find contact information for private airports.,2016,09
204,201610,COLORADO,AIRCRAFT X (A DRONE) WAS BEING SWITCHED TO MY FREQUENCY AS I WAS GETTING A RELIEF BRIEFING. THE PREVIOUS SECTOR WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY SWITCHING THE AIRCRAFT; AND AFTER HE WAS ABOUT 10 MILES INTO OUR AIRSPACE; HE FINALLY CHECKED ON. THE BRIEFING I WAS GIVEN WAS THE PILOT WAS SUPPOSED TO GIVE ME A 10 MIN WARNING BEFORE HE STARTED DROPPING BUOYS OUT OF HIS AIRPLANE; AND THAT HE NEEDED A 20 MILE RADIUS WITH NO AIRPLANES. AIRCRAFT X THEN ASKED TO START DROPPING THE BUOYS IN 3 MIN (NOT THE 10 MIN WARNING I WAS BRIEFED) AND THAT HE WANTED THE 20 MILE RADIUS. AS I TRIED TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON THE BUOYS; SIZE; SHAPE; HOW MANY; IF THEY GO ALL THE WAY TO THE GROUND; THE ONLY INFORMATION THE PILOT WAS ABLE TO TELL ME WAS THAT HE WANTED TO DROP ONE EVERY 10 MIN. I TOLD HIM HE WAS NOT AUTHORIZED TO DROP AT THAT MOMENT; THAT I HAD TO MOVE AIRPLANES OUT OF HIS WAY AND THAT I WOULD LET HIM KNOW WHEN HE COULD DROP THE FIRST ONE. I MOVED THE AIRPLANES; AND TRIED TO CALL HIM UP AND I DID NOT RECEIVE A RESPONSE. I TRIED HIM THREE MORE TIMES AND LET THE CIC KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON (ALTHOUGH; HE HEARD ME AND ALREADY HAD AN IDEA OF WHAT WAS GOING ON). HE GOT THE OM (OPERATIONS MANAGER) INVOLVED; WHO THEN CALLED TO THE PILOT ON THE PHONE. THE PILOT SAID THAT HE WAS HAVING COMMUNICATION ISSUES. ONCE THE PILOT REPORTED BACK ON MY FREQUENCY; I INFORMED HIM THAT I HAD BUILT HIM THE 20 MILE HOLE THAT HE HAD REQUESTED; BUT THAT I COULD NOT GET AHOLD OF HIM. IF HE REQUESTS TO BE DROPPING THINGS OUT OF THE AIRPLANE WITH A 20 MILE STERILIZED AIRSPACE; THEN HE HAS TO BE IN COMMUNICATION WITH ME AND MONITORING THE FREQUENCY. I AUTHORIZED THE FIRST DROP AND SWITCHED HIM TO THE NEXT SECTOR. AS I WENT TO GET THE CALL SIGN; A DIFFERENT OM WAS WORKING THE DESK AND I EXPLAINED THE SITUATION. HE TOLD ME THAT THEY DON'T NEED 20 MILES; HE HAS NO IDEA WHERE THAT CAME FROM; AND THAT THEY ARE AUTHORIZED TO DROP THE BUOYS OUT OF THE AIRPLANE. THE 10 MIN WARNING IS JUST AS A HEADS UP AND HE IS RESPONSIBLE SOLELY FOR THE RELEASE OF THE INSTRUMENTS. THE BUOYS ARE SMALL AND IF THEY RUN INTO ANOTHER AIRPLANE; NO HARM WILL COME TO THEM. HE THEN PROCEEDED TO TELL ME THAT I HAD NO AUTHORITY TO TELL THE PILOT THAT HE COULD NOT DROP THE BUOYS. HE PULLED UP THE SECTION OF THE 7110.65 AND SHOWED IT TO ME. THAT IS ALL GREAT AND WONDERFUL; BUT THAT INFORMATION WOULD HAVE SERVED ME AND THE DRONE PILOT MUCH BETTER PRIOR TO THIS INCIDENT. REGARDLESS OF THE RULES AND REGULATIONS; THE PILOT MUST BE ABLE TO COMMUNICATE WITH ATC IF HE IS GOING TO BE FLYING.TRAINING! CONTROLLERS NEED TO BE MADE AWARE OF THE SITUATION FULLY; NOT JUST AN 'OH BY THE WAY' MOMENT. NO ONE IN MY AREA; INCLUDING THE CIC OR OM; HAD ANY IDEA HOW TO HANDLE THE SITUATION. EVEN IF THERE WAS NO TIME TO GIVE A FORMAL BRIEFING TO EVERYONE THAT COULD BE WORKING THAT AIRCRAFT; INFORMATION COULD HAVE BEEN PROPERLY GIVEN TO THE CONTROLLERS IMMEDIATELY BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT CHECKED ON THE FREQUENCY. THE OM THAT I HAD SPOKEN TO AFTER THE INCIDENT WAS ANNOYED THAT I DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT WAS OK FOR A DRONE TO THROW THINGS OUT OF HIS AIRPLANE. AND THAT IT WAS RIDICULOUS THAT I WAS TRYING TO CLEAR A 20 MILE HOLE FOR THE AIRCRAFT. THAT HE HAD NO IDEA WHERE I HAD BEEN GIVEN THAT INFORMATION FROM. HE WAS SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT THE PILOT OF THE AIRCRAFT WAS ASKING FOR IT AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER THAN TO GIVE IT TO HIM.,Denver Center Controller reported of miscommunication and a lack of communication with a UAV pilot. The Controller was advised of a special request in which was not valid. The Operations Manager advised the Controller of what needed to be done.,2016,10
205,201610,MASSACHUSETTS,WHILE DESCENDING THROUGH 7;000 FEET BETWEEN BEREI AND BBOGG INTERSECTION ON THE ROBUC2 STAR INTO BOS; THE CAPTAIN REPORTED TO ME THAT HE SAW A SILVER AND WHITE COLORED DRONE 1;000 FEET BELOW OUR AIRCRAFT AND APPROXIMATELY 500 FEET OFF OUR 8 O'CLOCK POSITION. THE SIGHTING WAS REPORTED TO BOS APPROACH CONTROL.,A319 flight crew reported sighting a UAV below and to the left of their aircraft while descending through 7000 feet on the ROBUC2 arrival to BOS.,2016,10
206,201610,NEW YORK,SPOTTED A DRONE DURING TURN FROM DREMS INTERSECTION TO APPLE INTERSECTION AT 8000 FEET. SILVER DRONE; SIZE OF MAYBE A SMALL BAG WAS ABOUT 50-100 FEET ON THE STARBOARD SIDE SAME ALTITUDE MOVING EAST TO WEST. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS NECESSARY. FLIGHT CONTINUED NORMALLY.INFORMED APPROACH CONTROL. AFTER LANDING GROUND CONTROL GAVE US A PHONE NUMBER. PROVIDED ALL THE INFORMATION TO THIS NUMBER AND THEY SAID THEY WILL PUT IN A REPORT. AFTER ARRIVING AT HOTEL CONTACTED CHIEF PILOT AND INFORMED HIM OF WHAT HAPPENED ALSO.,CRJ-900 First Officer reported sighting a UAV at 8000 feet near DREMS on the MILTON4 Arrival to LGA. No evasive action was taken; but the UAV passed within 75 feet of the aircraft.,2016,10
207,201610,TEXAS,DURING COCKPIT SETUP AND PREFLIGHT BRIEF FIRST OFFICER (FO) AND I HAD DISCUSSED THE RELATIVE PROBABILITY OF TAKING OFF ON RWY 15L VS RWY 15R. WE WERE PREPARED FOR EITHER. TAXI OUT HAD BEEN A RUNWAY CHANGE DRILL. WE HAD SET UP FOR A 15L/WV DEPARTURE; BUT GOT ASSIGNED RWY 15R ON INITIAL TAXI. AT SPOT 2 WE GOT A LATE CHANGE BACK TO RWY 15L/WV FROM GROUND AND WERE TOLD TO CONTACT TOWER. TOWER CLEARED US FOR TAKEOFF WHILE STILL HALFWAY DOWN TAXIWAY WA. WE BOTH HEARD; 'TURN RIGHT TO 340; RUNWAY 15L WV CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF.' FO READ BACK 'TURN RIGHT TO 340.' FO WAS RUSHED; AND I HAD SLOWED OUR TAXI SPEED TO GIVE HIM TIME. HE HANDLED IT ALL VERY WELL; AND SHOWED NO PERFORMANCE DEGRADE OR TASK SATURATION. WITH CORRECT RWY TAKEOFF DATA INSTALLED AND VERIFIED; CHECKLISTS COMPLETE; WE TOOK THE RUNWAY AND TOOK OFF. AT 400 FEET AGL I INITIATED A RIGHT TURN TO 340. TOWER RADIOED; 'CONFIRM LEFT TURN TO 340.' I IMMEDIATELY REVERSED TURN TO THE LEFT. ABOUT THAT TIME WE GOT A TCAS RA TO 'MONITOR VERTICAL SPEED.' I DIDN'T NEED TO MANEUVER; BECAUSE THE AIRCRAFT ATTITUDE ALREADY HAD US PERFECTLY ALIGNED WITH THE RA GUIDANCE. FO AND I BOTH KNEW WHAT HAD HAPPENED. WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW CLOSE WE WERE TO THE AIRCRAFT OFF OF RWY 15R. THE RA WAS MOMENTARY; NO MORE THAN A COUPLE OF SECONDS. I KEPT THE LEFT TURN IN WHILE FO RESET THE HEADING BUG TO COMMAND LEFT TO 340. WHEN CLEAR OF CONFLICT; FO RADIOED SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF 'WE'RE SORRY BUT WE HEARD AND READ BACK CLEARANCE RIGHT TO 340.' TOWER REPLIED SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT OF 'NO PROBLEM; NO BIG DEAL.' WE WERE BOTH PRETTY ALARMED BY THE EVENT.WE CONTINUED TO CLIMB OUT UNEVENTFULLY; BUT THE COCKPIT WAS TENSE. WE WEREN'T SURE HOW THAT HAD HAPPENED. ONCE WE REACHED CRUISE; I USED THE CRM/THREAT ERROR MANAGEMENT SKILLS CARD TO DEBRIEF THE INCIDENT. WE ASSESSED THAT THE THREAT WAS ATC RADIO COMMUNICATIONS AND A HEARING/READ BACK ISSUE. WE WERE BOTH FAIRLY CERTAIN OF WHAT WE HAD HEARD; AND WE WERE VERY CERTAIN OF WHAT FO HAD READ BACK. IT DID NOT SEEM UNUSUAL TO US TO TURN RIGHT WHILE TAKING OFF FROM RWY 15L-- JUST THE DAY BEFORE WE HAD MADE A RIGHT HAND TURN TO HEADING 340 WHILE TAKING OFF ON RWY 15L/WV. CLEARLY THERE HAD BEEN AN ERROR. WE WERE NOT SURE WHETHER THE ERROR WAS OURS; OR TOWER'S; OR BOTH. WE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY THAT ONE OR BOTH OF US HAD HAD AN EXPECTATION BIAS BASED ON OUR INITIAL TURN OUT HEADING CLEARANCE ON THE DAY BEFORE. REGARDLESS; WE HAD REPAIRED THAT ERROR. THE TCAS RA HAD ALSO PRESENTED US WITH AN UN-COMMANDED AIRCRAFT STATE (UAS); HOWEVER BRIEF. WE HAD CORRECTLY RECOVERED PER PROCEDURE. THE AIRCRAFT WAS QUICKLY RETURNED TO A SAFE OPERATIONS STATE. WE ASSESSED THAT SAFETY MARGINS HAD BEEN ERODED BUT NOT COMPROMISED. TOWER MADE A TIMELY AND CORRECT RADIO CALL TO ALERT US TO A MISTAKE. OUR RECOVERY PROCEDURE HAD WORKED PERFECTLY. THREATS AND ERRORS HAD BEEN REPAIRED. WE HAD INDEED PREPARED DURING OUR PREFLIGHT BRIEFING (WHICH; INCIDENTALLY; INCLUDED A COMMENT ABOUT AVOIDING THE THREAT OF COMPLACENCY). WE HADN'T VIOLATED ANY SOPS; BUT FOR REASONS THAT WERE NOT CLEAR TO US; WE HAD TURNED OPPOSITE TO THE CLEARANCE INTENDED BY THE TOWER CONTROLLER. BASED ON OUR RADIO CALLS AFTER THE FACT; WE WERE PRETTY SURE THAT TOWER WAS NOT GOING TO INITIATE ACTION AGAINST US. BUT WE WERE STILL NOT SURE WHERE THE RADIO COMMUNICATIONS HAD BROKEN DOWN; AND THAT REMAINS AN UNANSWERED QUESTION.,Air Carrier flight crew departing IAH Runway 15L reported turning the wrong direction on departure; received a correction call from the Tower Controller and an RA soon thereafter. Crew reported reversing the turn. Crew reported runway assignment was changed before departure.,2016,10
208,201610,UTAH,PREFLIGHTED THE AREA THAT DAY; LOOKING FOR ACTIVE TFRS OR CONTROLLED AIRSPACE. THE AREA I WANTED TO FLY AT LOOKED CLEAR OF SLC OR ANY TFRS. I WENT TO FLY LOW LEVEL OVER A POND AT MEMORY GROVE PARK; UT (2-10AGL). I TOOK OFF; HOVERING AT 6 FT AGL; AND MY PHONE PROVIDED AN ALERT I MAY BE CLOSE TO A CAUTION AREA (DJI APP NOTIFICATION). I WAS 5 MILES EAST OF SLC; I OPENED MY PHONE TO PULL UP THE SLC VFR TAC; AND NOTICED I WAS CLOSER THAN EXPECTED TO THE BORDER OF THE SLC CLASS B SHELF. I IMMEDIATELY LANDED THE AIRCRAFT FROM THE 10 FT AGL ALTITUDE. THE DURATION OF THE FLIGHT WAS AROUND 1 MINUTE. FROM NOW ON; I'LL ALWAYS USE THE GPS IN GARMIN PILOT IN CORRELATION WITH THE VFR SECTIONAL; VFR TAC; AND CONTINUE CHECKING FOR ACTIVE TFRS BEFORE I FLY AT THE EXACT LOCATION. AS SMALL DRONE OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE BECOMING MORE COMPLEX AND USER FRIENDLY; I'D BE GOOD FOR THEM TO INCORPORATE THE VFR SECTIONALS AND TAC INTO THE OPERATING SYSTEM TO MAKE PILOTS FULLY AWARE OF THEIR LOCATION IN RELATION TO AIRSPACE AROUND THEM.,A DJI Phantom UAS pilot launched after checking diligently for TFR and controlled airspace. However; after takeoff his DJI phone app alerted his aircraft proximity to SLC Class B. The UAS flight was aborted.,2016,10
209,201611,ARIZONA,WE WERE EXECUTING THE FLIGHT PORTION OF A 61.53 FLIGHT REVIEW AND WINGS PHASE. WE PERFORMED A SIMULATED ENGINE-FAILURE NORTH OF [A PRIVATE] AIRPORT; INCLUDING A LOW APPROACH TO THE TRAFFIC PATTERN. THERE WERE NO OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE PATTERN OR THE VICINITY. WINDS WERE LIGHT AND VARIABLE. A GO-AROUND WAS EXECUTED AT 200 FEET AGL; AND WE CLIMBED BACK TO 4;500 FEET FOR OUR RETURN TO [OUR HOME AIRPORT]. AS WE LEVELED 12 MILES NORTHEAST OF DVT; WE RECEIVED A RADIO CALL ON THE DEER VALLEY NORTH TOWER FREQUENCY; FROM AN UNIDENTIFIED STATION; ASKING IF WE WERE ON FREQUENCY. WE ACKNOWLEDGED; AND THE VOICE ADVISED US THAT [THE AIRPORT WE TRAINED AT] IS A PRIVATE AIRPORT; AND THAT LANDINGS AND LOW APPROACHES ARE NOT PERMITTED. WE ACKNOWLEDGED THAT TRANSMISSION.I AM AWARE THAT [THE AIRPORT] IS PRIVATE. WE DID NOT LAND; ONLY EXECUTED A TRAINING LOW APPROACH AND GO-AROUND. THERE IS NO AIRPORT/FACILITY DIRECTORY ENTRY FOR [THE PRIVATE AIRPORT]; AND I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT LOW APPROACHES CAN BE PROHIBITED BY THE AIRPORT OPERATOR. THERE IS NO RESTRICTED AIRSPACE AT THAT AIRPORT.IT IS NOT CLEAR WHETHER THE TRANSMISSION CAME FROM DVT TOWER OR FROM SOMEONE ON THE GROUND AT [THE PRIVATE AIRFIELD] TRANSMITTING ON THE DVT TOWER FREQUENCY. IN ANY CASE; THE CALLER DID NOT IDENTIFY. WE WILL AVOID THIS AIRPORT COMPLETELY IN THE FUTURE.,BE35 Instructor reported of conducting a simulated engine out approach to a private airport and go around without landing. A few minutes later; someone voiced an objection to the maneuver on the Tower frequency of a nearby airport.,2016,11
210,201611,ARIZONA,ON DOWNWIND TO RUNWAY 11L IN KTUS WE WERE BRIEFLY TARGETED BY A GREEN LASER WHICH WE REPORTED TO APPROACH. THE CONTACT WAS BRIEF AND DID NOT AFFECT THE EYES OF ANY OF THE CREW PRESENT. WE TURNED FROM DOWNWIND TO BASE AND AFTER A MINUTE OR SO THE LASER AGAIN BEGAN TARGETING US AGAIN. IT WAS CONSTANT AND ACCURATE. THE FLIGHT DECK WAS LIT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS. I HAD A GOOD IDEA WERE THE LASER WAS COMING FROM ON THE GROUND AND I POSITIONED MYSELF SO AS TO USE THE METAL AROUND THE WINDSHIELD PANELS TO SHIELD MY EYES FROM THE STRIKES. SEVERAL MORE HITS WERE MADE ON THE AIRCRAFT AND I WAS AWARE THAT SEVERAL SWEPT REARWARDS ALONG THE FUSELAGE.AT THIS POINT WE WERE WITH TOWER AND WE REPORTED THE CONTINUED LASER STRIKES TO TOWER. OUR JUMP-SEATER HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN A POLICE OFFICER IN THE AREA AND HE WAS ABLE TO PINPOINT THE STREET INTERSECTIONS IT WAS ORIGINATING FROM AND WE PASSED THAT ON TO THE TOWER STAFF. WE LANDED SAFELY AND TAXIED TO THE GATE. I MADE A PA TO THE PASSENGERS AND ASKED IF ANYONE BACK THERE HAD HAD THEIR SHADES OPEN AND HAD BEEN HIT IN THE EYES BY THE LASER. I TOOK THE NAMES AND SEAT NUMBERS OF THE AFFECTED PASSENGERS. THERE WERE 2 PASSENGERS WHO CAME FORWARD. I HAVE KEPT THIS INFORMATION WRITTEN ON THE FLIGHT RELEASE AND WILL KEEP IT; FOR COMPANY OR FAA INVESTIGATIONS THAT MAY ENSUE. I ASKED THEM IF THEY HAD ANY PAIN; VISION LOSS OR ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS. BOTH STATED THEY FELT NO ILL EFFECTS.NO UAS (UNDESIRED AIRCRAFT STATE) OCCURRED. THE THREAT WAS ALL FROM THE EXTERIOR.,Regional Jet Captain reported being targeted by a green laser while on downwind to Runway 11L at TUS; no crew were effected but 2 passengers reported being hit.,2016,11
211,201611,CALIFORNIA,ON SHORT FINAL (ABOUT 100 FT) I SAW A FLOCK OF BIRDS MOVING NORTH AWAY FROM THE RUNWAY. I MENTIONED THE BIRDS TO THE CAPTAIN AND HE ACKNOWLEDGED. SINCE THEY WERE MOVING AWAY I ELECTED TO LAND. AS THE MAIN LANDING GEAR WAS TOUCHING DOWN A FLOCK OF BIRDS (NOT SURE IF THEY WERE THE SAME) FLEW IN FRONT OF THE AIRCRAFT FROM THE NORTH. THERE WERE MULTIPLE BIRD STRIKES TO THE AIRCRAFT TO INCLUDE ON MY CANOPY.I COULD STILL SEE SO I KEPT THE PILOT FLYING ROLL AND COMPLETED THE LANDING ROLL. WE BROUGHT THE AIRCRAFT TO A STOP AND INFORMED THE TOWER OF THE BIRD STRIKES ON THE APPROACH END OF RUNWAY 08. TOWER WAS SURPRISED AND SENT OUT OPS. WE PULLED INTO OUR GATE. ON INSPECTION OF THE AIRCRAFT WE SAW MULTIPLE BIRD STRIKES TO INCLUDE LEFT WING FUSELAGE; AND NUMBER 2 ENGINE. OPS REPORTED 20 DEAD PIGEONS. WE CONTACTED TOWER BY PHONE AS WELL.,B737 flight crew reported a bird strike with about 20 pigeons while on short final to BUR.,2016,11
212,201611,GEORGIA,FLYING INTO [A HELICOPTER PAD IN ATLANTA] ON SHORT FINAL WE ENCOUNTERED A DRONE ON OUR DIRECT FLIGHT PATH FOR LANDING. I ANNOUNCED TO CREW I WAS TAKING EVASIVE ACTION; BEFORE I COULD INITIATE EVASIVE ACTION THE DRONE DROPPED DOWN AND TO THE RIGHT OUT OF OUR FLIGHT PATH. IT WAS NOT SEEN AGAIN.,Helicopter pilot reported a UAV in his path on short final to a helipad. The UAV pilot maneuvered away before the helicopter pilot could and was not seen again.,2016,11
213,201611,NEW YORK,WHILE OPERATING A SUAS IN CLASS G AIRSPACE; UNDER A JFK NOTAM FOR ALMOST 2 MINUTES IN FLIGHT; UAS PILOT NOTICED A LAW ENFORCEMENT HELICOPTER APPROACHING SUAS IN FLIGHT HOVERING WITHIN THE AIRSPACE DESCRIBED BELOW; BETWEEN THE SURFACE AND 400 FEET AGL. KJFK JOHN F KENNEDY INTL-AIRSPACE UAS WI AN AREA DEFINED AS 1NM RADIUS OF XXX/XX SFC-400FT AGL. I; THE SUAS REMOTE PILOT; HAD FILED SAID NOTAM TO OPERATE SAFELY IN THE STATED CONFINES. AS PER THE FARS; I LOWERED AND SAFELY LANDED THE SUAS AND YIELDED TO THE MANNED LAW ENFORCEMENT AIRCRAFT THAT WAS OPERATING AT APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET AGL. I THEN CALLED JFK TOWER AND ALERTED THE CONTROLLER THAT I WAS OPERATING WITHIN THE CONFINES OF AN ACTIVE NOTAM AND TO COMMUNICATE THAT MESSAGE WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AVIATION UNIT. UNIFORMED POLICE OFFICERS ARRIVED AND WERE SHOWN THE NOTAM AND RECORDED MY IDENTIFICATION INFORMATION. AFTER SPEAKING WITH THE OFFICERS; I AGREED NOT TO RELAUNCH THE SUAS. I FELT I HAD TAKEN PRECAUTIONARY ACTIONS TO FLY SAFELY AND LEGALLY IN THIS AIRSPACE. THE FLIGHT LAUNCHED AND LANDED IN VACANT PUBLIC LAND WITH NO SPECTATORS/UNINVOLVED PERSONS IN SIGHT.IN THE FUTURE; BOTH SIDES EXCHANGED TELEPHONE NUMBERS AND WE AGREED TO OPEN A DIRECT LINE OF COMMUNICATION WITH THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AVIATION UNIT; EVEN WHILE FLYING IN CLASS G AIRSPACE.,UAS pilot; operating legally near JFK after filing a flight plan and NOTAM for the flight; was approached by a law enforcement helicopter. The pilot landed the UAV to avoid airborne conflict then cancelled his flight after discussions with authorities.,2016,11
214,201611,VIRGINIA,FLIGHT DEPARTED RUNWAY 06 AT ROA. INITIAL HEADING WAS 070 WITH A CLIMB TO OUR REQUESTED VFR ALTITUDE. A FEW MINUTES LATER; ROA TOWER CLEARED US ON COURSE (SOUTH). AFTER LEVELING AT 3000 FEET MSL; WE OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SMALL UNMANNED AIRCRAFT OF MODERATE SIZE (3 FEET OR LESS); POSSIBLY A QUADCOPTER APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET ABOVE AND 200 FEET TO OUR LEFT (EAST). IT APPEARED TO BE MANEUVERING BUT NOT CONVERGING WITH US. WE CONTINUED ON OUR HEADING AND ALTITUDE AND INFORMED TOWER OF THE SIGHTING.,DA20 instructor pilot reported a NMAC with a UAV east of ROA at 3000 feet. No evasive action was required.,2016,11
215,201612,CALIFORNIA,ADULT PASSENGER (NON-PILOT) IN CO-PILOT SEAT REPORTED TO ME THAT A SMALL DRONE PASSED BY OUR AIRCRAFT ON THE STARBOARD SIDE (THE DRONE WAS HEADING IN A NORTHERLY DIRECTION). DISTANCE WAS UNCERTAIN. NO REPORT OF DRONE WAS HEARD WHILE MONITORING ATC.,A pilot on approach to SJC Runway 30L near KLIDE at 6;000 ft was told by his passenger their aircraft was passed by a UAS traveling north.,2016,12
216,201612,CALIFORNIA,IN CRUISE FLIGHT AT FL360; SHORTLY AFTER COMPLETING THE DESCENT AND APPROACH BRIEF; WE RECEIVED A 'FUEL QUANTITY FAULT' ALERT. THIS WAS QUICKLY FOLLOWED BY THE FUEL SYSTEM REVERTING TO MANUAL AND THE DISPLAY OF A 'SELECT FUEL MANUAL' ALERT. THE SYNOPTIC PAGE INDICATED THE NUMBER 3 MAIN TANK FUEL QUANTITY HAD FAILED AND WAS REPLACED WITH AN AMBER X. THE REVERSION TO MANUAL FUEL MANAGEMENT BROUGHT ON ALL TANK PUMPS. WE ALSO NOTICED THE LOSS OF PROF [DESCENT PROFILE] INDICATIONS; AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF NUMEROUS VALUES IN THE FMC AND ON THE SPEED TAPE.  WE RAN THE QRH FOR FUEL QUANTITY FAULT BECAUSE IT WAS THE INITIAL FAULT THAT BEGAN THIS SERIES OF EVENTS. THE CHECKLIST DIRECTS THE CREW TO CALCULATE THE FUEL REMAINING IN THE AFFECTED TANK BY SUBTRACTING THE FUEL USED FROM THE DEPARTURE FUEL FOR THE FLIGHT. WITH THE DISPATCHED MEL FOR #1 FUEL FLOW; THE FUEL USED ON # 1 ENGINE WAS BLANK AND THEREFORE THERE WAS NO WAY TO DO THIS AS DIRECTED. THE ONLY OPTION TO ESTIMATE THE FUEL IN THE TANK WAS BY REFERENCING THE OTHER MAIN TANKS KNOWING THE FUEL SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN BALANCE PRIOR TO THE FAULT. WE WERE TANK TO ENGINE ON THE FUEL FLOW; SO THEY SHOULD BE RELATIVELY SIMILAR. SINCE IT WAS REFERENCED IN THE QRH; WE CHECKED THE UFOB ON THE INIT PAGE AND IT WAS BLANK. THIS EXPLAINED THE LOSS OF PROF AS THE FMS HAD NO UFOB VALUE; HENCE NO AIRCRAFT GW TO CALCULATE SPEEDS AND PROFILES. EVEN AFTER CALCULATING THE ESTIMATED ONBOARD FUEL AND TRYING TO INITIALIZE THE UFOB IN THE FMS; THE FMS WOULD NOT ACCEPT THE VALUE. THIS WAS BECAUSE THERE WAS NO FUEL USED INDICATIONS FOR THE FMS TO USE TO UPDATE THE FUEL ON BOARD AND GROUND WEIGHT AS FUEL WAS BURNED TO PROVIDE ACCURATE DATA FOR SPEED AND DECENT CALCULATIONS. UNABLE TO GET ANY PROFILE INFORMATION FROM THE FMS; WE REVERTED TO MANUAL FLYING OF THE DESCENT USING 3 TO 1 PLANNING AND USING THE VVI AND REMAINING TIME TO TURN POINTS TO GAUGE OUR PROGRESS. DUE TO LACK OF APPROACH SPEED INFO FROM THE FMS; WE USED THE QRH APPROACH TABLES TO CALCULATE THE APPROACH SPEED. TO CONFIRM THE VALUE WAS ACCURATE; WE WOULD BE REFERENCING THE AOA AS WE CAREFULLY SLOWED TO APPROACH SPEED.  AS WE APPROACHED TOP OF DESCENT; CENTER SLOWED US DOWN TO 250 KNOTS. WE BEGAN OUR DESCENT AS SOON AS CLEARED AND WERE LOOKING GOOD ON THE STAR PROFILE. HOWEVER; CENTER LEVELED US OFF FOR TRAFFIC AT FL190 AND KEPT US THERE FOR SOME TIME. BY THE TIME CENTER GAVE US CLEARANCE TO CONTINUE THE DESCENT; WE COULD NOT MAKE THE SUBSEQUENT RESTRICTIONS. WE INFORMED CENTER AND THEY ACKNOWLEDGED; TELLING US TO REJOIN THE PROFILE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE FROM ABOVE. WE REJOINED THE PROFILE AT ABOUT 6000 FEET. DESCENDING THROUGH ABOUT 7000 FEET; THE #3 MAIN TANK INDICATION RETURNED TO NORMAL AND WE GOT THE FMS INFORMATION BACK. WE FOUND THAT OUR FUEL ESTIMATE WAS VERY CLOSE AND THE APPROACH SPEED WAS AS WELL. WE FLEW A VISUAL APPROACH AND LANDED UNEVENTFULLY. THE QRH PROCEDURE FOR FUEL QUANTITY FAULT SHOULD BE AMENDED TO INCLUDE THE SCENARIO OF HAVING A FUEL FLOW INOPERATIVE. IT CREATES NUMEROUS ISSUES FOR THE DESCENT AND LANDING. WE HAD ENOUGH TIME IN CRUISE TO EVALUATE THE SITUATION BEFORE BEGINNING DESCENT; BUT IF SOMEONE HAD THIS PROBLEM ON DESCENT ON A CLEAR DAY WITH LITTLE FUEL; A CREW COULD BE PRESSED BY THEIR FUEL STATE BEFORE HAVING ENOUGH TIME TO DIAGNOSE SOMETHING THEY'VE NEVER ENCOUNTERED. A CLEAR DEFINITION OF THIS SPECIFIC SITUATION IN THE QRH COULD BE CRITICAL.THE FLIGHT LANDED IN VFR CONDITIONS AT THE DIVERSION AIRPORT AND TAXIED TO THE GATE WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. THE PRIMARY CAUSE OF THIS EVENT WAS AN AIRCRAFT COMPONENT MALFUNCTION THAT RESULTED IN AN UNCONTROLLABLE CABIN ALTITUDE.,MD11 First Officer reported being dispatched with an MEL for number one fuel flow inoperative. Approaching Top of Descent the number three tank fuel quantity failed rendering many FMC calculations. QRH procedures were not accomplished due to the lack of any fuel numbers from the FMC. Numbers returned to normal during descent.,2016,12
217,201612,LOUISIANA,I WAS OPERATING A DRONE UNDER PART 107 COLLECTING AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHS OF A TIMBER HARVEST AREA. I HAD FILED A UAS OPERATING AREA REPORT WITH FLIGHT SERVICES IN AN EFFORT TO WARN AIR TRAFFIC I WOULD BE OPERATING IN THE AREA; THE ALTITUDE I WOULD BE AT; AND THE EXACT TIMES OF OPERATION. WE ALSO HAD A HAND HELD VHF AVIATION RADIO TURNED ON AND OPERATING ON 122.9 FREQUENCY. A VISUAL OBSERVER WAS ALSO ON SITE AND FULLY BRIEFED. APPROXIMATELY 15 SM [FROM] BTR THE DRONE WAS OPERATING AT 375 FT AGL FLYING A GRID PATTERN OVER [AREA WE WERE TO PHOTOGRAPH]. I WAS FACING SOUTH MAINTAINING VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE DRONE; MY VISUAL OBSERVER WAS FACING NORTH IN MY BLIND SPOT; THE DRONE WAS 692 FT LATERALLY FROM MY LOCATION. THE VISUAL OBSERVER YELLED OUT AN AIRCRAFT SIGHTING REPORT; I TURNED TO LOOK AND SAW A CESSNA 172 FLYING AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME ALTITUDE AS THE DRONE ON WHAT APPEARED TO BE A COLLISION COURSE APPROXIMATELY .4-.25 MILES FROM THE DRONES POSITION. THE CESSNA PILOT DID NOT SEEM TO SEE THE DRONE; HE WAS OPERATING AT OR BELOW 500 FT IN MY ESTIMATION; AND WAS OBSCURED FROM VIEW ON THE GROUND BEHIND A TREE LINE UNTIL HE CLEARED THE TREES. WE DID NOT HEAR HIS ENGINE UNTIL AFTER HE CLEARED THE TREES. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK EVASIVE ACTION; REDUCING DONE ALTITUDE TO GROUND LEVEL AS FAST AS POSSIBLE (CUT THE ENGINES). THE DRONE CRASH LANDED AND DID NOT VISIBLY IMPACT THE CESSNA; THE CESSNA CONTINUED ON WITHOUT VISIBLE DEVIATION FROM ITS FLIGHT ROUTE. IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THE CESSNA WAS OPERATING AS A PIPELINE PATROL AIRCRAFT SINCE A PIPELINE WAS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY AND THE PILOT WAS AT SUCH A LOW ALTITUDE. THIS WAS A VERY HIGH POTENTIAL NEAR MISS. WHILE I WAS ABLE TO SEE AND AVOID THE CESSNA IT IS DEBATABLE IF HE WAS ABLE TO SEE MY DRONE. IF THE CESSNA PILOT HAD FILED A FLIGHT PLAN OR CALLED FLIGHT SERVICES I FEEL HE SHOULD HAVE HAD AMPLE WARNING OF MY INTENDED AREA OF OPERATION AND FLIGHT LEVEL. AS A LICENSED SUAS OPERATOR AND A CURRENT STUDENT PILOT I CAN SEE CONFLICTS BETWEEN LOW FLYING AIRCRAFT AND DRONES OUTSIDE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE BECOMING MORE COMMON; ESPECIALLY IN CASES LIKE MY EXPERIENCE. THERE NEEDS TO BE A BETTER WAY TO FREELY COMMUNICATE DRONE ACTIVITIES WITH PILOTS AND MORE EMPHASIS GIVEN TO PILOTS TO CHECK UAS OPERATING AREAS BEFORE THEY FLY; ESPECIALLY WHEN FLYING BELOW OR NEAR 400 FT AGL.,Drone pilot operating under FAR part 107 reported a NMAC with a C172 at about 400 feet AGL. Evasive action was taken by the drone operator while the C172 pilot apparently did not detect the drone.,2016,12
218,201612,MINNESOTA,CLIMBING THROUGH ABOUT 10;000 FT TO A CLEARED ALTITUDE OF 17;000 FT WE ENCOUNTERED A SMALL FAST MOVING OBJECT COULD HAVE BEEN A BALLOON OR A RC DRONE A FEW HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US AND TO THE RIGHT MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION (SO IT HAD APPEARED AT THE TIME). THE CONTROLLER ASKED US IF WE WERE IN THE TURN TO THE WAYPOINT TO WHICH CLEARED TO A FEW MOMENTS BEFORE; I SAID YES WE ARE IN THE TURN NOW AND EXPLAINED I HAD DELAYED THE TURN FOR A FEW SECONDS TO ENSURE THE OBJECT PASSED AND WAS ENSURING VISUAL SEPARATION AND ENHANCING FLIGHT SAFETY TO ATTEMPT TO ACTUALLY ACQUIRE WHAT THE CONFLICT WAS. THE OBJECT COULD HAVE BEEN A BALLOON AS WELL BUT THE SHAPE WAS MORE CONSISTENTLY THAT OF A RC DRONE.   IF IT WAS A DRONE MAYBE THE FAA SHOULD NOT HAVE ALLOWED THE USE OF THEM INTO THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE WITHOUT PROPER CERTIFICATED TRAINING OF THE USER TO FORCE THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFETY OF ALL THOSE THAT USE THE AIRSPACE SYSTEM; AND LOBBYING FOR THE MANUFACTURING COMPANIES TO PHYSICALLY RESTRICT THEIR ABILITY TO OPERATE UNDER THE DEVICES OWN POWER FROM ALTITUDES GREATER THAN 300 FT AND WITHIN A CERTAIN RADIUS FROM KNOWN AIRPORTS (ESPECIALLY IN THE CLASS B AND C AIRSPACE LATERAL BOUNDARIES).,CRJ-200 Captain reported an airborne object; either a balloon or UAS; near 10;000 feet while departing MSP.,2016,12
219,201612,NEW MEXICO,MY CONTROLLER WORKING R46 ASKED ME TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SCOPE. HE TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS HAHO (HIGH ALTITUDE HIGH OPENING) OPERATIONS AT E60 AND THEY HAD JUST DROPPED AND WE COULD SEE THE PRIMARY TARGETS RETURNING TO E60. WHEN THE CONTROLLER ASKED ME TO LOOK THE JUMPERS WERE ABOUT 4 MILES SOUTH OF E60 DRIFTING BACK. THERE WAS AN UNIDENTIFIED TARGET AT 7500 FEET HEADING SOUTH THAT WAS ABOUT 2 MILES SOUTH OF E60. THE CONTROLLER TRANSMITTED IN THE BLIND HOPING THE PILOT WAS MONITORING THE FREQUENCY. THE TARGET FLEW DIRECTLY THROUGH THE PRIMARY TARGETS OF THE JUMPERS AND THEN MADE A 40 DEGREE LEFT TURN. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT ALTITUDE THE JUMPERS WERE AT BUT THIS AIRCRAFT FLEW DIRECTLY INTO THE PRIMARY TARGETS.IF THE JUMPERS AT E60 WANT TO EXECUTE HAHO JUMPS THE PILOT SHOULD CIRCLE DOWN ABOVE THE HIGHEST JUMPER SO THAT WE CAN TALK TO THE PILOT AND HE CAN GIVE US UPDATES ON WHERE THE JUMPERS ARE.,ZAB ARTCC FLM reported observing an unidentified VFR aircraft fly through the path of skydivers at 7500 feet.,2016,12
220,201612,OHIO,UAV WAS BEING FLOWN OVER PARENT'S HOME AND SURROUNDING NEIGHBORHOOD WITHIN VISUAL LINE OF SIGHT. AT TIME OF INCIDENT; UAV WAS BEING FLOWN AT APPROXIMATELY 200 FT AGL. UPON HEARING AN APPROACHING HELICOPTER; UAV WAS IMMEDIATELY COMMANDED TO DESCEND AND LAND AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WHILE UAV WAS DESCENDING; HELICOPTER ENTERED VIEW OF PILOT ON THE GROUND AND HELICOPTER FLEW OVERHEAD OF UAV WITHOUT ALTERING FLIGHT PATH. UAV WAS NEVER IN THE DIRECT PATH OF HELICOPTER. IT WAS ORIGINALLY ASSUMED OPERATION WAS CONDUCTED OUTSIDE OF CLASS B DUE TO DISTANCE TO CLE BEING GREATER THAN 5 STATUTE MILES. UPON REVIEW AFTER THE INCIDENT; OPERATION WAS ONLY 4.5 NAUTICAL MILES FROM CLE AND WITHIN THE CLASS B.,UAV pilot reported flying his UAV at 200 feet AGL at what he believed was beyond 5 NM from CLE. An evasive descent was initiated when a helicopter was sighted in the area; but no actual conflict existed. Later he discovered the distance to be 4.5 NM from CLE and inside the Class B.,2016,12
221,201612,TEXAS,APPROACHING ELP FROM THE EAST; WE WERE LEVEL AT 6;500 WHEN ATC ASKED US IF WE HAD BOTH EL PASO AND BIGGS IN SIGHT. WE WERE NIGHT VMC WITH GREAT VISIBILITY AND CALLED BOTH FIELDS IN SIGHT. ATC THEN CLEARED US FOR A VISUAL APPROACH. BOTH THE FIRST OFFICER AND I HAD THE RUNWAY 22 ILS SELECTED IN OUR NAVIGATION DISPLAYS AND THE ILS CHART ON OUR IPADS. THE EGPWS DISPLAYED GREEN 47 OVER 44 IN THE RANGE SELECTED; SO I SET THE ALTITUDE ALERT FOR 5;900 THAT THE CHART DEPICTED FOR CROSSING AGUAS AT 3.4 MILES OUTSIDE THE MARKER VALTR. AT 5;900 WE RECEIVED A TERRAIN WARNING. IT WAS VMC; BUT NIGHT SO I BEGAN A CLIMB UNTIL THE WARNING SILENCED (WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED FEET). WE THEN DECIDED TO CAPTURE THE GLIDE PATH FROM OUR NEW ALTITUDE ABOVE 5;900 FEET WITH THE EGPWS SILENT.IN THE FUTURE I THINK I'LL REFUSE VISUAL APPROACHES INTO ELP AT NIGHT EVEN IN VMC CONDITIONS. I FELT 'THE TRAP' AT ELP WOULD BE MAKING SURE BOTH EL PASO AND BIGGS WERE IN SIGHT. ALSO USING THE ILS WOULD BE ADDITIONAL ASSURANCE. THE EGPWS APPARENTLY SAW SOMETHING BETWEEN 6;500 (OUR ALTITUDE WHEN THE VISUAL APPROACH WAS ASSIGNED) AND 5;900 FEET (THE NEXT DEPICTED ALTITUDE ON OUR APPROACH CHART).,MD-80 flight crew reported climbing in response to a GPWS 'Terrain' warning on a night visual approach to ELP.,2016,12
222,201612,WASHINGTON,ON SHORT FINAL WE ENCOUNTERED A DRONE APPROXIMATELY 1300 FEET AGL JUST TO THE RIGHT OF THE RUNWAY CENTERLINE. I WAS THE PILOT MONITORING AND THE FLIGHT OPERATED NORMALLY UP TO THE FINAL APPROACH FIX. THE CAPTAIN PILOT FLYING (PF) HAD JUST DIRECTED GEAR DOWN; FULL FLAPS JUST PRIOR TO THE ENCOUNTER. I SAW OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE A DARK OBJECT JUST [TO] THE RIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT; BUT PERCEIVED IT TO BE EITHER A REFLECTION (THE SUN WAS TO OUR LEFT AND BEHIND A LITTLE); OR POSSIBLY A BALLOON. I INITIALLY DISMISSED IT; UNTIL THE AIRCRAFT IN FRONT OF US BEGAN TALKING TO TOWER ABOUT A DRONE ON SHORT FINAL AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 FEET. I ESTIMATE THE DRONE WAS 2-3 FEET IN DIAMETER; DARK IN COLOR; AND ROUGHLY 30-50 FEET RIGHT AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE OUR POSITION ON FINAL. WE REPORTED OUR ENCOUNTER TO TOWER AFTER LANDING.,An air carrier First Officer reported a NMAC with a drone while on short final at SEA.,2016,12
223,201701,ARIZONA,I WAS OPERATING MY DRONE UNDER PART 107 DURING AN AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY MISSION. ON INITIAL SETUP I CHECKED THE FAA B4UFLY APP AND NOTICED THAT THE AREA I WAS CURRENTLY IN WAS RESTRICTED. ONCE I CHECKED UNDER THE REASONS WHY IT INFORMED ME THAT IT WAS DUE TO ALERT AREA A-231. I THEN CHECKED MY TERMINAL AREA CHART ON FOREFLIGHT TO SEE WHAT THE RESTRICTIONS WERE FOR A-231 AND FOUND OUT THAT IT WAS FROM 500 AGL TO 6500 MSL. THE OPERATION I INTENDED TO PERFORM WAS ONLY GOING TO BE UP TO 100 AGL AND I QUICKLY GLANCED TO MAKE SURE I WAS NOT IN CONFLICT WITH ANY OTHER AIRSPACE AND UNDER THE B SHELF. HAVING DONE MOST OF MY FLIGHT TRAINING IN PHOENIX I FELT THAT I WAS CERTAIN THAT IT WAS ACCEPTABLE TO OPERATE MY DRONE. AFTER NO CONFLICTS AND COMPLETING THE FLIGHT; THEN PROCEEDED TO ANOTHER PROPERTY LOCATED A STREET OVER. AGAIN I WAS PROMPTED THAT FLIGHT WAS RESTRICTED DUE TO A-231; AGAIN I CONTINUED TO PROCEED CAUTIOUSLY. AFTER PERFORMING 3 OPERATIONS ALL WITHIN THE SAME AREA I STOPPED FOR THE DAY. LATER THAT EVENING IT BOTHERED ME THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHY I WAS GETTING A RESTRICTED MESSAGE AND I LOOKED AT THE TERMINAL CHART ONCE AGAIN. I THEN NOTICED THAT NEXT TO THE A-231 BOUNDARY THERE IS AN SATR (SPECIAL AIR TRAFFIC RULES) STARTING AT THE SURFACE AND UP TO 4000. THE SATR STATES THAT ALL AIRCRAFT NEED TO ESTABLISH TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION WITH AND MAINTAIN COMMUNICATION WITH LUKE APP WHILE OPERATING IN THE AIRSPACE. IT IS THEN; THAT I REALIZED THAT I MAY HAVE BEEN IN CONFLICT WITH THIS SATR AND RIGHT ON THE BORDER OF THE DEFINING LIMITS. MY PREVIOUS FLIGHT EXPERIENCE IN THE AREA LEAD ME INTO A TRAP OF NOT CHECKING THE AIRSPACE AS CLOSELY AS I SHOULD HAVE BECAUSE THE SATR IS NEW SINCE I LAST OPERATED FLIGHTS IN THE AREA. GOING FURTHER; I NEED TO PAY EXTRA CAUTION TO ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION INCLUDING THE B4UFLY APP TO AVOID ANY FURTHER CONFLICTS.,A UAS pilot operating near LUF realized he was flying in Alert Area A-231; but thought it was legal below 500 feet. He later discovered he may have been operating in the Special Air Traffic Rules Area within A-231 which requires prior communication with ATC.,2017,01
224,201701,ARIZONA,I WAS WORKING THE LOCAL 1 POSITION; TRAINING IN PROGRESS. THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WAS GETTING UNWIELDY; SO I TOOK OVER AND STARTED TO CLEAN UP THE SEQUENCE. AIRCRAFT X WAS NUMBER 1 ON 3 MILE FINAL RUNWAY 3R. THREE AIRCRAFT WERE ON THE DOWNWIND; EXTENDED TO FOLLOW AIRCRAFT X. I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AIRCRAFT Y CUT OUT AIRCRAFT X; BUT REALIZED IT WAS AIRCRAFT X APPEARING TO BE ON RIGHT BASE RUNWAY 3R; INSIDE THE DOWNWIND. I RE-CLEARED AIRCRAFT X; AND THAT WAS WHEN AIRCRAFT Z ADVISED NMAC WITH AIRCRAFT X.THE PILOT OF AIRCRAFT X SHOULD HAVE ADVISED ME WHAT HE WAS DOING; ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS SAFETY RELATED (BIRDS; FOR INSTANCE). I COULD HAVE AT THE VERY LEAST CALLED TRAFFIC.,PRC Local Controller observed an aircraft that had been established on final maneuvered on its own to a base leg position on a conflicting course with downwind traffic.,2017,01
225,201702,ARIZONA,AIRCRAFT WAS ON AUTOPILOT; SET ON CRUISE POWER AT APPROXIMATELY 230 KNOTS WHEN WHAT APPEARED TO BE BIRDS OR BALLOONS APPEARED. ATTEMPTED A SMALL COURSE CORRECTION BUT THE AUTOPILOT WAS TOO MUCH TO OVERCOME AND THEN REALIZED IT WAS SKYDIVERS. REACHED TO DISENGAGE; BUT BY THAT TIME I WAS ALREADY BENEATH THEM AND ONE WAS VERY CLOSE MAYBE 200 FEET. PASSED BY WITH NOTHING HAPPENING; BUT POSSIBLE IRRITATED SKYDIVERS.  THE PROBLEM RESULTED FROM NOT KNOWING THE AUTOPILOT SYSTEM WELL AND TRAVELING AT HIGH SPEED IN A KNOWN PARACHUTING LOCATION. THE REACTION TIME AFTER UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU ARE SEEING AT HIGH SPEEDS IS VERY SHORT. NEVER IN 20 YEARS OF FLYING HAVE I SEEN FREE FALLING PARACHUTES. I DID NOT RECOGNIZE WHAT IT WAS UNTIL TOO CLOSE. MY FUTURE ACTION TO AVOID A SITUATION LIKE THIS IS TALK TO FLIGHT FOLLOWING WHEN TRANSITIONING JUMP ZONES AS JUMPERS ARE HARD TO SPOT.,GA pilot reported an NMAC with parachutists in a known jump zone near MZJ.,2017,02
226,201702,FLORIDA,I WAS ATTEMPTING TO LAND AT RUNWAY 27U TURF AT X51 WHEN I HEARD THE RAMP VEHICLE COME ON UNICOM ASKING TO CROSS 27U. I CALLED FINAL FOR 27U AND THE AIRPORT CAR STATED THAT IT IS HOLDING FOR ME. THE AIRPORT CAR DISTRACTED ME SO I CAME IN 15KTS FAST AND DECIDED TO GO AROUND AFTER PASSING 1/3 OF THE RUNWAY WITHOUT TOUCHING DOWN. AS I WAS TURNING BASE TO FINAL I WAS INFORMED OF BIRD ACTIVITY NEAR THE RUNWAY DISTRACTING ME FROM FLYING THE AIRCRAFT. I FINALLY SPOTTED THE BIRDS AND DETERMINED THAT THEY WERE OF NO CONFLICT WITH MY FLIGHT PATH. ON SHORT FINAL I WAS HAVING DIFFICULTY LOCATING THE RUNWAY ENVIRONMENT DUE TO POOR AIRPORT MARKINGS. I WAS CERTAIN I WAS LINED UP ON THE RUNWAY RIGHT UP UNTIL I TOUCHED DOWN AT WHICH POINT THE TERRAIN WAS MUCH ROUGHER THAN I RECALL FROM MY PRIOR LANDINGS ON THE TURF RUNWAY. UPON TURNING OFF OF THE RUNWAY WE TAXIED OVER TO THE TIE DOWN AREA WHERE WE WERE INFORMED BY THE AIRPORT MANAGER THAT WE HAD LANDED TO THE SIDE OF THE GRASS RUNWAY IN THE GRASS. I WAS INFORMED THAT NO TOUCH AND GOES WERE PERMITTED ALONG WITH LANDING AN AIRCRAFT OVER 3600 LBS. THE AFD DID NOT INDICATE THAT EITHER PROHIBITED. THEY WENT ON TO SAY THAT ONLY TAIL DRAGGERS; HELICOPTERS AND GLIDERS ARE PERMITTED TO LAND ON THE GRASS.,GA pilot reported he landed to the side of the grass runway 27U at X51.,2017,02
227,201702,NEW YORK,ON APPROACH INTO NEW YORK'S LAGUARDIA AIRPORT; RUNWAY 31; WE EXPERIENCED A WIND SHEAR EVENT THAT CAUSED A GO AROUND. DURING THE GO AROUND WE WERE ASSIGNED AN ALTITUDE OF 3000 FT. UPON REACHING 3000FT THE CAPTAIN ASKED FOR ME TO REQUEST A BLOCK OF AIRSPACE FROM ATC BECAUSE WE WERE STRUGGLING TO KEEP PROPER PITCH AND WINGS LEVEL ATTITUDE IN MODERATE TURBULENCE. DUE TO WORKLOAD AND ATC CONGESTION I WAS UNABLE TO MAKE THE REQUEST AND ONE UPDRAFT BALLOONED US TO AN ALTITUDE THAT WAS APPROACHING 3200 FEET. ONCE WE GOT TO A HIGHER; AND SLIGHTLY SMOOTHER ALTITUDE WE HANDLED THE BLEED ONE OVER PRESSURE THAT HAD OCCURRED AT APPLICATION OF MAX THRUST DURING THE WIND SHEAR EVENT; AND ASSESSED THE SITUATION. WE THOUGHT IT BEST TO DIVERT TO JFK FOR MORE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS. WE LANDED UNEVENTFULLY.,ERJ-175 crew reported 2 missed approaches due to wind shear followed by a diversion because of low fuel.,2017,02
228,201702,SOUTH CAROLINA,AIRCRAFT X WAS ON A VFR PRACTICE APPROACH TO RUNWAY 1 AT GMU. AN UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT DEPARTED RUNWAY 5 AT GYH AND TURNED SOUTHBOUND. BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF CLOSE CALLS AND I WASN'T BUSY; I NOTICED THE AIRCRAFT SQUAWKING 1200. SINCE THE AIRCRAFT WERE CONVERGING; I CALLED GYH TOWER TO FIND OUT THE AIRCRAFT'S INTENTIONS. I THEN INSTRUCTED GYH TOWER TO TURN THE AIRCRAFT TO A 090 DEGREE HEADING. THIS TOOK CARE OF THE ISSUE.BECAUSE THIS SITUATION HAPPENS QUICKLY; WITHOUT WARNING; AND WITH MULTIPLE FREQUENCIES INVOLVED; WE CAN'T ENSURE THAT THIS WON'T LEAD TO A MIDAIR COLLISION. I AM TOLD THE FAA IS ABOUT TO GET A SECOND BRIEFING FOR A PROPOSED DBRITE (TOWER RADAR DISPLAY) FOR GYH. HOPEFULLY [THEY] WILL APPROVE IT; BUT I DOUBT [THEY] KNOW ABOUT THE LAST TWO INCIDENTS.THE DBRITE IS VERY IMPORTANT; BUT MUST BE PAIRED WITH VFR DEPARTURE PROCEDURES FOR GYH. MY SUPERVISOR SUGGESTED THAT ALL VFR DEPARTURES OFF GYH SHOULD EXIT THE CLASS D LATERALLY. THIS WOULD KEEP THE AIRCRAFT FROM CLIMBING ABOVE 1800 FEET BEFORE GETTING 5 MILES FROM GYH. THIS WOULD SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCE THE RISK TO THE SYSTEM. IT WOULD REQUIRE MORE PHRASEOLOGY FROM GYH TOWER. SOMETHING LIKE REMAIN AT OR BELOW 1800 FEET UNTIL 5 MILES FROM GYH AND OUTSIDE OF GMU CLASS D AND GSP CLASS C. IF UNABLE; ADVISE. LAST YEAR GYH TOWER; GMU TOWER; AND GSP TOWER TRIED TO REACH AN AGREEMENT ABOUT VFR DEPARTURES; BUT FAILED. IF IFR/VFR TRAFFIC IS A TOP 5 ISSUE AND THE FAA HAS THE CAPACITY TO MANAGE THE SYSTEM; THIS CAN BE FIXED EASILY AND QUICKLY. IT NEEDS TO BE FIXED IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE SOONER OR LATER; OUR LUCK WILL RUN OUT.,A Controller reported a VFR aircraft depart an airport that was going to be in confliction with their aircraft on approach so they issued a vector away to the the VFR aircraft.,2017,02
229,201702,TEXAS,ALMOST HIT A DRONE WHILE EXECUTING AN RNAV APPROACH INTO DWH.,PA28 instructor pilot reported a near miss with a drone while on approach to DWH.,2017,02
230,201702,TEXAS,WE WERE CLEARED FOR A VISUAL TO 31L OFF A RIGHT DOWNWIND. PRECEDING AIRCRAFT REPORTED A VERY NEAR MISS WITH A DRONE AT 500 AGL ON 31L. WE WERE INTENTLY LOOKING FOR THE DRONE. FIRST ERROR WAS LINING UP ON 31R. TOWER QUERIED US ABOUT OUR ALIGNMENT AT FOUR MILES AND WE SIDESTEPPED TO 31L. WE CONTINUED TO CONFIGURE WHILE LOOKING FOR THE DRONE. I CALLED FOR FLAPS 30. PM SET FLAPS 25. WE WERE BOTH OUTSIDE LOOKING FOR THE DRONE BELOW 1000 FT. 'TOO LOW FLAPS' ALERT. WE CONFIGURED FLAPS 30 AND LANDED.,Air carrier First Officer reported being distracted by a reported UAV in the area of Runway 31L at DAL; missed setting flaps 30 and received a 'Too Low Flaps' alert. Crew set flaps and landed uneventfully.,2017,02
231,201702,VIRGINIA,WE WERE APPROACHING CHO RUNWAY 3 FROM THE NORTH IN RIGHT TRAFFIC. WE HAD BRIEFED THAT THERE WAS A MOUNTAIN RIDGE 4000' (ACCORDING TO THE 10-7 PAGE) TO THE WEST OF THE AIRPORT AND THAT RIGHT TRAFFIC WOULD BE MORE APPROPRIATE. THE MSA TO THE NORTHWEST WAS 4900' AND TO THE SOUTHEAST WAS 2000' OF GORDONSVILLE VOR. WE WERE CLEARED FOR THE VISUAL APPROACH AND TO BROADCAST ON ADVISORY SINCE TOWER WAS CLOSED. WE WERE DOWNWIND DESCENDING MIDFIELD TO 2600' THINKING WE WERE APPROPRIATELY CLEAR OF THE TERRAIN AND THE 1796' TOWER LOCATED ON THE DOWNWIND. AS WE WERE ABOUT TO TURN BASE; WE WERE NOTICING THE SECTOR HEIGHT TURNING YELLOW AT 025. THEN WE RECEIVED A 'TERRAIN' AURAL CAUTION EGPWS AND TOOK APPROPRIATE EVASIVE ACTION CLIMBING TO 3000 FEET.THE MAIN THREAT IS THE TOWER ON DOWNWIND AND THE CANTED MSA LINE FOR TERRAIN BASED ON GVE VOR WHICH IS FURTHER SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FIELD. WE WERE ATTEMPTING TO STAY SAFE AND GET CONFIGURED EARLY OUTSIDE THE SIPME FINAL APPROACH FIX AS APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A STABILIZED APPROACH. WE CHOSE RIGHT DOWNWIND TO SAFELY AVOID THE 4000' MOUNTAIN RIDGE 10 MILES WEST OF THE FIELD MENTIONED IN THE 10-7 PAGE. SECONDARILY; IT WAS LATE IN THE DAY AND WE WERE APPROACHING 12 HOURS OF DUTY. I THINK THE ERROR IS THAT WE MISSED THAT MSA LOCATION MAYBE ASSUMING IT TO BE FURTHER NORTH AND CENTERED ON THE FIELD. THE UAS IS DEFINITELY THAT THE EGPWS CAUTION PARAMETERS WERE SET OFF BASED ON OUR ALTITUDE NEAR TERRAIN AND/OR MANMADE OBSTACLE IN THE DOWNWIND. A GREAT DEAL WAS LEARNED FROM THIS EVENT. FORTUNATELY IT WASN'T A MORE EXTREME EGPWS WARNING; BUT A UAS NONETHELESS. WE NEED TO BE BETTER AT SITUATIONAL AWARENESS IN TERRAIN AT NIGHT BY PLANNING BETTER AND HAVING A BETTER IDEA OF THE LOCATION OF THE NAVAID THAT THE MSA IS BASED ON. HERE IT WAS FURTHER SOUTH THAN WE THOUGHT. AT NIGHT; AS WE DO IN A PLACE LIKE AVL; WE SHOULD BE ON A SEGMENT OF THE ILS POSSIBLY AT THIS LOCATION BEFORE ACCEPTING THE VISUAL. WE GOT INTO THE VISUAL APPROACH MINDSET AND THOUGHT WE WERE SAFELY APPROACHING. WE NEED TO PAY MORE ATTENTION ON THESE CLEAR NIGHTS WHEN THESE THREATS ARE PRESENT SO AS TO AVOID THIS UAS.,Air Carrier crew reported they received a TERRAIN warning on a night visual approach to runway 3 CHO. Crew reported climbing and made a successful landing.,2017,02
232,201703,ARIZONA,WE WERE [DOING] A PROCEDURE WHERE WE LAND AS MANY AIRCRAFT AS POSSIBLE ON RUNWAY 26 TO HELP OUT THE TOWER FROM HAVING TO STOP DEPARTURES AND CROSS THE DEPARTURE RUNWAY FOR AIRCRAFT THAT LAND RUNWAY 25L. THIS WASN'T A CAUSAL FACTOR. I HAD AIRCRAFT X ON A NORTHBOUND HEADING; ASSIGNED 040. AS HE WAS DESCENDING THROUGH 050; I NOTICED A TARGET THAT APPEARED TO HAVE DEPARTED SOUTHBOUND; CLIMBING OUT OF 032. I INSTRUCTED AIRCRAFT X TO STOP HIS DESCENT AND ISSUED THE TRAFFIC. THE UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT'S FLIGHT PATH WOULD TAKE HIM JUST TO AIRCRAFT X'S LEFT SIDE. AIRCRAFT X STOPPED AT 045 AND WAS LOOKING FOR THE TRAFFIC. AT THIS POINT; THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED A CLIMB AND AIRCRAFT X RESPONDED TO A TCAS RA. NO SEPARATION WAS LOST; AND THE UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT STOPPED THE CLIMB AT 038. AIRCRAFT X ADVISED HE WAS CLIMBING. THERE WAS ANOTHER AIRCRAFT THAT THE OTHER FINAL HAD; AIRCRAFT Y; THAT WAS GOING TO LAND ON THE SOUTH SIDE. I WAS GOING TO GO UNDER AIRCRAFT Y WITH AIRCRAFT X; HE WAS GOING TO STAY ON TOP. I GAVE AIRCRAFT X THE TRAFFIC AND HE ADVISED ME THAT HE WOULD STOP AT 050; AND THANKED ME FOR THE TRAFFIC. BOTH AIRCRAFT LANDED WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.THIS HAPPENS ALL THE TIME. AIRCRAFT DEPART FFZ AND SKIRT THE BRAVO; WHICH GOES DOWN TO 040. GIVEN THE PROXIMITY TO PHX; IT'S IMPERATIVE TO GET THOSE [INBOUND AIRCRAFT] DOWN SO THEY CAN MAKE THE DESCENT TO LAND AT THE AIRPORT. WE NEED A NEW BRAVO LAYOUT. THIS HAPPENS WAY TOO MANY TIMES. THE BRAVO NEEDS TO BE CHANGED AND HOPEFULLY [REPORTING] WILL BE THE VEHICLE FOR WHICH IT IS INTENDED.,Phoenix TRACON Controller reported problems with the Phoenix Class Bravo and VFR aircraft close to it which causes arrival problems.,2017,03
233,201703,CALIFORNIA,ON APPROACH TO SJC THE CAPTAIN POINTED OUT A DRONE THAT WAS IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE AIRCRAFT. AS I GLANCED OUT THE RIGHT WINDOW I COULD SEE THE DRONE MANEUVERING AS THE SUN REFLECTED OFF OF ITS SURFACE IN RAPID MOTION.THIS IS A SYSTEMIC PROBLEM IN THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM WITH POTENTIALLY TRAGIC RESULTS SHOULD AN INDIVIDUAL; OR GROUP; CHOOSE TO USE A DRONE AS A WEAPON AGAINST AN AIRCRAFT. I CAN ONLY SPECULATE BUT IT WOULD NOT SEEM TO TAKE TOO MUCH EFFORT BY A MOTIVATED PARTY TO INTENTIONALLY IMPACT AN AIRCRAFT DURING THE LANDING OR TAKEOFF PHASE OF A FLIGHT. BASED ON MY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF THE GUIDANCE OF SAID DRONES; I CAN ONLY SPECULATE AS WHAT SORT OF TECHNOLOGY COULD THWART THIS THREAT OUTSIDE OF SOME TYPE OF FREQUENCY BAND JAMMING.,B737 flight crew reported sighting a drone in close proximity to their aircraft while on approach to SJC near KLIDE.,2017,03
234,201703,DC,CLIMB OUT FROM IAD WITH A STEP-UP LEVEL OFF OF 10;000. AUTO THROTTLES ENGAGED BUT HAND FLYING THE AIRCRAFT. LIGHTWEIGHT AIRCRAFT. AFTER RECEIVING CLEARANCE FROM ATC; I DIALED IN 10;000 FEET ON THE MCP; BUT FAILED TO REALIZE THAT UPON REACHING THAT ALTITUDE THE AUTO THROTTLES WILL PUSH UP THE THROTTLES TO ACCELERATE; NOT BRING THE THROTTLES BACK AS NORMAL. DUE TO THE AIRCRAFT BEING LIGHTWEIGHT; THE THROTTLES INCREASING POWER RATHER THAN DECREASING POWER; AND LACK OF A FASTER INSTRUMENT SCAN; I BALLOONED THROUGH THE ASSIGNED ALTITUDE (APPROXIMATELY 550 FEET). THE AIRCRAFT WAS DESCENDED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. WHILE RECOVERING TO 10;000 FEET; THE CONTROLLER STATED 'AIRCRAFT X; SAY ALTITUDE.' THE AIRCRAFT WAS ALREADY DESCENDING THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 10;200 FEET AND LEVELING; AND MY RESPONSE WAS 'LEVELING ONE ZERO THOUSAND FEET.' THE CONTROLLER RESPONDED 'ROGER'; BUT MADE NO OTHER COMMENTS. THE REST OF THE FLIGHT WAS UNEVENTFUL.LACK OF AWARENESS OF WHAT THE AUTO THROTTLES WOULD DO ON A LEVEL OFF AT EXACTLY 10;000 FEET. SLOW INSTRUMENT SCAN. SOME FATIGUE; AFTER A 12 HOUR PERIOD; FLYING AT NIGHT.,B757 flight crew reported an overshoot on level off at 10000 feet with the autothrottle engaged and hand flying due to the power levers advancing to increase speed.,2017,03
235,201703,DELAWARE,[UAS] OPERATOR WAS DEMONSTRATING EQUIPMENT CAPABILITIES. PILOT SELF-IDENTIFIED THIS ISSUE. PILOT WAS REMINDED OF PROPER PROCEDURES. PILOT WAS USING POOR JUDGMENT.,A UAS pilot knowingly flew his aircraft to an altitude of 60 feet within 5 miles of DOV.,2017,03
236,201703,FLORIDA,WHEN VECTORED INBOUND TO STUART FROM THE EAST; I OBSERVED A DRONE FLYING JUST OFF THE LEFT WING. WE ADVISED APPROACH CONTROL AND THEN TOWER AT SUA OF THE PLACEMENT AND ALTITUDE OF THE DRONE AND GAVE THEM A DESCRIPTION.,Corporate jet pilot reported a near miss with a UAS while on a vector east of SUA.,2017,03
237,201703,GEORGIA,I WAS FLYING A DRONE OVER MY HOUSE AND REALIZED I WAS TECHNICALLY FLYING IN CLASS D WITH NO PERMISSION TO FLY THERE.  DRONES CREATE A NEW AND UNKNOWN AREA OF OPERATIONS AS THIS CASE DEMONSTRATES.  I WAS WELL FAR FROM THE AIRPORT (ALMOST AT THE LATERAL CLASS D LIMITS); AND I WAS FLYING VERY LOW; SO I WAS NOT ENDANGERING ANY TRAFFIC.  HOWEVER; IT HAS BEEN BUGGING ME THAT I DID FLY IN CLASS D WITHOUT PERMISSION.  I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WHAT I WOULD DO DIFFERENTLY.  FOR EXAMPLE; PERHAPS I WOULD TRY TO CONTACT THE TOWER WITH MY HAND-HELD RADIO.  THIS WOULD BE DIFFICULT BECAUSE I AM NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO GET A GOOD SIGNAL TO THE AIRPORT.  SHOULD I HAVE GIVEN THEM A CALL TO LET THEM KNOW?  WOULD THEY THINK I WAS NUTS IF I CALLED THEM ABOUT A LITTLE DRONE THAT WOULD NOT HAVE AN EFFECT ON THEIR OPERATIONS?  THESE QUESTIONS DO NEED TO BE ANSWERED; AND IT IS NOT CLEAR TO ME WHERE THE LINE IS DRAWN.  FOR EXAMPLE; IT WOULD BE TOO CONSERVATIVE TO SUGGEST THAT I COULD NOT FLY THE DRONE 4 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND; OR EVEN UP TO ROOF TOP LEVEL.  I FELT COMPELLED TO WRITE THIS NOT ONLY TO ADMIT I MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING I SHOULD NOT HAVE; BUT ALSO TO SPUR THE CONVERSATION OF WHAT SHOULD AND SHOULD NOT BE DONE WITH DRONES IN TECHNICALLY CONTROLLED AIRSPACE.NOTE: THIS WAS THE THIRD OR SO OCCURRENCE OF THIS OPERATION IN THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS; AND THE REPORTED DATE ONLY REFLECTS THE MOST RECENT OCCURRENCE.,A UAS pilot flying his aircraft low near his home realized it was in PDK Class D airspace. He was uncertain what action he should take to notify ATC about his intended flight.,2017,03
238,201703,OHIO,AFTER DOING A DAY LONG COURSE ON PART 107 AND FAA EXAM PREP; I ACTED AS A RPIC (REMOTE PILOT IN COMMAND) AND ANOTHER RPIC WERE DEMONSTRATING TO OUR CLASS THE SAFE OPERATION OF DRONES. A PILOT IN A CHEROKEE PA-28 LANDED AND A PLANE WAS ON FINAL. WE WERE WELL OFF OF ANY RUNWAY AND SAFELY CONDUCTED OUR DEMONSTRATION. AS THE AIRCRAFT WAS CLEARING THE RUNWAY WE PUT BOTH DRONES ON THE GROUND. WE WERE NOT NEAR THE AIRCRAFT AND WE WERE FAR AWAY FROM THE RUNWAY SAFELY DEMONSTRATING ON THE FAR WEST TAXIWAY OF THE APRON. THE PILOT IN THE CHEROKEE STARTED ACCUSING MYSELF AND THE OTHER RPIC FOR ILLEGAL FLYING A DRONE IN CLASS D AIRSPACE. WE CORDIALLY TOLD HIM WE WERE IN CLASS G AIRSPACE AND FLYING PURSUANT TO PART 107. HE KEPT SAYING THAT WE WERE NOT AND WERE OPERATING ILLEGALLY. WE THEN INFORMED OUR CLASS OF THE MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE REGULATIONS AND HOW PART 91 PILOTS AND PART 107 SHARE THE NAS AND HOW WE NEED TO WORK TO EDUCATE EACH OTHER AND EFFECTIVELY COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER.,A commercial pilot instructing a UAS ground school class at 3G3 Airport (Wadsworth; OH) was confronted by an aircraft pilot who accused him of flying in Class D airspace. His UAS flew below CLE Class B and outside CAK Class C.,2017,03
239,201704,ARIZONA,IN A SIMULATED ENGINE FAILURE; I WAS DESCENDING AND CIRCLING OVER MY POINT OF INTENDED LANDING WHEN WHAT APPEARED TO BE A WHITE BIRD WAS IN SIGHT. ONCE I GOT CLOSER IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS A DRONE FLYING WELL ABOVE THE ALTITUDE REQUIREMENTS FOR PART 107 AND FAR TOO CLOSE TO OUR AIRCRAFT. THE OTHER PILOT NOTICED THE DRONE AND POINTED IT OUT TO ME WHEN WE TOOK EVASIVE ACTION AND MADE A CLIMBING LEFT TURN WESTBOUND TO AVOID ANY OTHER CONFLICT. WE MADE A REPORT WITH APPROACH.,C172 pilot reported a UAS near miss at 3;200 ft southeast of PHX.,2017,04
240,201704,ARIZONA,I MAY HAVE FLOWN WITHIN A FIVE MILE RADIUS OF PHX WHILE USING A DRONE TO LOOK AT DAMAGE TO A FRIEND'S ROOF. I MADE CERTAIN; BEFORE FLYING; THAT THE FLIGHT WAS NOT GOING TO ENTER CLASS B AIRSPACE (AND IT DID NOT COME NEAR CLASS B AIRSPACE). IT WASN'T UNTIL AFTER THE FLIGHT THAT I REALIZED I MAY HAVE FLOWN; CLOSE TO; OR EVEN WITHIN; THE FIVE MILE RADIUS OF AN AIRPORT WITH AN OPERATING CONTROL TOWER. THE MAXIMUM ALTITUDE REACHED WAS 60 FT AGL.,UAV operator reported he may have operated within 5 miles of PHX airport at an altitude of 60 feet AGL.,2017,04
241,201704,CALIFORNIA,WHILE BEING VECTORED THROUGH ONT LOC 26R APPROACH COURSE FOR SPACING FROM OTHER AIRLINE TRAFFIC; A LARGE DRONE WAS SPOTTED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO OUR JET. WE WERE HEADING ROUGHLY NORTH AT 6000 FT. THE DRONE WAS ABOUT 500 FEET BELOW AND 100 TO 200 YARDS TO OUR LEFT. LOOKING ON GOOGLE MAP; IT WAS APPROXIMATELY AT THE INTERSECTION OF HIGHWAY 215 AND 10 NEAR A GOLF COURSE. THIS WAS IMMEDIATELY REPORTED TO ONT APPROACH CONTROL (SOCAL). I WAS THE ONLY ONE THAT SAW IT FROM OUR COCKPIT. FO WAS FLYING. THE DRONE WAS LARGE; APPEARED TO BE A FOUR OR MORE ENGINES; AND ABOUT THREE FEET IN DIAMETER. LOOKED LIKE TWO TONE DARK AND LIGHT COLOR. MAYBE BLUE AND WHITE OR GREEN AND WHITE. WATCHED FOR ABOUT 4 TO 7 SECONDS AS WE PASSED IT.,B737 Captain reported sighting a large drone while being vectored for an instrument approach near ONT.,2017,04
242,201704,CALIFORNIA,MY PASSENGER SPOTTED A DRONE WHILE WE WERE IN CRUISE FLIGHT NEAR MONTEREY BAY; JUST WEST OF WATSONVILLE AIRPORT.  MY PASSENGER STATED THAT IT CAME 'VERY CLOSE' TO OUR PLANE; BUT I WAS UNABLE TO SPOT IT BEFORE WE HAD PASSED ITS LOCATION. I INFORMED ATC; BUT DUE TO FREQUENCY CONGESTION I MADE MY REPORT AFTER WE HAD FLOWN 2 MILES NORTH OF WHERE WE ENCOUNTERED IT. UPON LANDING; I REVIEWED THE NOTAMS FOR MY PREFLIGHT BRIEFING AND WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANY FOR UAS ACTIVITY AT THAT ALTITUDE.,DA40 pilot reported his passenger noticed a UAV operating in close proximity to their aircraft at 6500 MSL in the vicinity of WVI airport.,2017,04
243,201704,MINNESOTA,WITNESSED MALE OPERATING UAV UP TO ESTIMATED 500 FEET AGL IN AREA OF TRAFFIC PATTERN OF SGS. OPERATOR WAS FREQUENTLY OUT OF LINE OF SIGHT OF UAV AND WAS OPERATING WHILE TALKING ON CELL PHONE. AIRCRAFT WERE USING PATTERN AT TIME.,A private pilot observed a UAV pilot operating his drone in the vicinity of SGS airport.,2017,04
244,201704,NEVADA,WHILE FLYING BACK WITH A STUDENT WE WERE TRANSITIONING FROM THE LAKE MEAD AREA WHICH IS 20 MILES EAST OF LAS AND JUST NORTH OF BVU DOWN TO THE SOLAR PANEL FARM JUST SOUTH OF BVU TO CROSS OVER BACK TO HND. WHILE HEADED TOWARDS THE BVU AIRPORT CTAF WAS TUNED IN TO CHECK FOR TRAFFIC AND POSSIBLE SKYDIVING IN ACTION. ON THE TRIP NORTH THERE HAD BEEN SKYDIVING IN PROGRESS BUT THIS TIME NO ONE HAD MADE ANY REPORTS WHEN WE ASKED FOR ADVISORY. THOUGH WE COULD SEE AND HEAR HELICOPTER TRAFFIC ON THE GROUND AND LOW LEVELS NO ONE ELSE FIXED WING HAD REPORTED. AS WE GOT ABOUT 2-3 MILES TO THE NORTH I COULD SEE WHAT LOOKED LIKE A POSSIBLE AIRCRAFT AT THE SAME ALTITUDE HEADED IN AN UNKNOWN DIRECTION BUT COULD NOT MAKE A POSITIVE ID ON THEM DUE TO THE SIZE. IT LOOKED TOO SMALL TO BE AN AIRPLANE AND WAS HARD TO KEEP AN EYE ON. AT THAT POINT I DIVERTED TO THE RIGHT SLIGHTLY TO BE SAFE. AS WE WERE HEADED SW TO PASS ABOUT A MILE NW OF THE AIRPORT THE TARGET CONTINUED TO GET CLOSER AND WE HAD YET TO HEAR THEM REPORT; I CONTINUED TO TURN RIGHT TO REMAIN CLEAR. DURING THIS TIME I WANTED TO CLIMB BACK UP TO GET READY TO CROSS THE RIDGE BUT IF SO WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SEE AS WELL DUE TO THE INCREASED PITCH SO I WAS STUCK AT 4000 AND SINCE THE 172 IS A HIGH WING PLANE I DID NOT WANT TO DESCEND DUE TO THE LOSS OF TRAFFIC VISIBILITY AND HAVING NO IDEA OF THE OTHER AIRCRAFT'S INTENTIONS. AT THIS POINT I NOTICED THE OTHER AIRCRAFT; HANG GLIDER OR DRONE WAS ONLY COMING CLOSER. I IMMEDIATELY MADE A DESCENDING LEFT HAND TURN HOPING THAT THERE WOULD NOT BE A COLLISION. FROM OUR POINT OF VIEW IT LOOKED AS IF WE CAME WITHIN 50 FEET OF EACH OTHER. THE CLOSEST I HAVE EVER COME TO ANYTHING SO FAR WITH FLYING. I COULD NOT BELIEVE ON A COMPLETELY CLEAR DAY WITH GREAT WEATHER THAT I WOULD HAVE A CLOSE OF A CALL AS THIS. I HOPE THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ADSB BECOMES MANDATORY AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. AT LEAST SO ONE OF THE PILOTS HAS THE ABILITY TO DETECT THE OTHER TRAFFIC. IF NEITHER OF US WOULD HAVE SEEN EACH OTHER TODAY IT COULD HAVE ENDED UP MUCH WORSE.,C172 instructor pilot reported having to take evasive action to avoid an object near BVU. He described the object as either another aircraft; a hang glider; or a drone.,2017,04
245,201704,NEW JERSEY,AFTER BEING CLEARED DIRECT TEB BY NY APPROACH; WHILE DESCENDING THROUGH 3300 FT A DRONE WAS OBSERVED PASSING BENEATH THE AIRCRAFT BY APPROXIMATELY 200-300 FT. LOCATION WAS 3.5 NM WEST OF TEB AT APPROXIMATELY 3000 FT. DRONE WAS 3-4 FT OF WINGSPAN MOVING EAST TO WEST AT AN INDETERMINABLE SPEED (WE WERE AT 180 KTS). WHITE IN COLOR; NO MARKINGS. EVENT REPORTED TO ATC. WE NEEDED NO EVASIVE ACTIONS AND CONTINUED A VISUAL APPROACH TO AN UNEVENTFUL LANDING.,A320 flight crew reported sighting a UAV in the vicinity of TEB at 3;300 feet.,2017,04
246,201704,NEW JERSEY,DURING APPROACH TO TETERBORO ON THE ILS RUNWAY 6 AT APPROXIMATELY 2000 FEET MSL IN VMC JUST INSIDE VINGS INTERSECTION; A LARGE RED DRONE CROSSED UNDERNEATH THE AIRCRAFT FROM LEFT TO RIGHT APPROXIMATELY 500-800 FEET BELOW. THE FLIGHT CREW BARELY NOTICED ANYTHING OTHER THAN A BRIEF FLASH OF COLOR IN AN AREA WHERE THERE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY AIRCRAFT AND THERE WAS NO TCAS TRAFFIC INDICATED. SHORTLY AFTER LANDING; THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT REPORTED SEEING A LARGE RED DRONE PASS UNDERNEATH THE LEFT WING; CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO SEE THE ROTORS SPINNING ON THE DRONE. THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT WAS LOCATED AT SEAT 5; MID-CABIN ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT AND HAD A FAIRLY GOOD VIEW OF THE AREA TO THE LEFT AND BELOW THE AIRCRAFT. WITHOUT KNOWING THE SIZE OF THE DRONE; IT WOULD BE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE LATERAL AND VERTICAL SEPARATION FROM THE TARGET BUT IT IS FAIRLY CLEAR THE DRONE WAS WELL ABOVE THE 600 FEET AGL LIMIT. TETERBORO GROUND WAS ADVISED OF THE ENCOUNTER DURING TAXI WHICH PROMPTED A FOLLOW-UP CALL TO THE FLIGHT CREW FROM NEW YORK APPROACH CONTROL OPERATIONS WHO TOOK A REPORT. COMPANY WAS NOTIFIED AND AN OPERATIONAL INCIDENT REPORT WAS FILED. AS PILOTS; WE HAVE BECOME QUITE ACCUSTOMED TO LOOKING FOR CONFLICTING FULL SIZED AIRCRAFT TRAFFIC AND RELYING ON TCAS TO PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF AWARENESS AND SAFETY. IN A LARGE METRO AREA; AT RELATIVELY LOW ALTITUDE; CLOSE IN TO AN AIRPORT; IT IS JUST NOT PART OF THE NORMAL TRAFFIC SCAN TO BE LOOKING BELOW THE AIRCRAFT UNLESS HELICOPTER TRAFFIC HAS BEEN CALLED OR TCAS INDICATES A POTENTIAL THREAT. THE NEW REALITY IS THAT LOW ALTITUDE DRONE AIRCRAFT ARE INCREASINGLY INVADING ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE CORRIDORS AROUND AIRPORTS DUE TO PROLIFERATION OF THE DEVICES; LACK OF AWARENESS OR TRAINING OF THE OPERATORS; AND LAX OVERSIGHT BY THE FAA THAT HAS ALLOWED THE PROLIFERATION OF THESE THREATS TO AVIATION SAFETY. THEIR SMALL SIZE; HAPHAZARD FLIGHT PATHS; AND UNREGULATED OPERATIONS MAKE THEM AN EXTREMELY DIFFICULT THREAT TO IDENTIFY AND MITIGATE WHILE IN FLIGHT. GREATER VIGILANCE IS REQUIRED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THIS ISSUE.,Corporate jet Captain reported a near miss with a UAV on approach to TEB Runway 6 at 2000 ft.,2017,04
247,201704,NEW YORK,TOOK OFF FROM FRG RUNWAY 32. WE WERE GIVEN MULTIPLE LEVEL OFFS AND HEADING ASSIGNMENTS TO GET US AROUND KENNEDY/NY AIRSPACE AND EVENTUALLY ON COURSE. CLOUD BASES WERE SCATTERED AT ABOUT 7500 FEET. AT THE TIME OF THE ENCOUNTER; WE WERE VMC; LEVEL AT 7000 FEET; SPEED 240KNOTS. I WAS COMPARING AIRCRAFT WE COULD SEE OUTSIDE WITH WHAT WAS BEING SHOWN ON THE TCAS. I THEN SAW; WHAT I INITIALLY THOUGHT WAS; A SEAGULL AT OUR ALTITUDE. CLOSER EXAMINATION AND PROXIMITY REVEALED IT WAS A DRONE AT OUR ALTITUDE. THE CLOSING SPEED WAS AT LEAST 240 KNOTS POSSIBLY MORE. IT PASSED OFF OUR RIGHT WING TIP BY ABOUT 50 FEET. IT WAS BLACK; ABOUT THE SIZE OF A BAKING SHEET. THERE SEEMED TO BE AN APPARATUS HANGING FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE DRONE THAT WAS METALLIC IN COLOR. POSSIBLY A RIG TO DROP AN OBJECT BUT I CAN'T BE CERTAIN OR KNOWLEDGEABLE ENOUGH TO MAKE A CERTAIN CLAIM. I MADE A REPORT TO ATC GIVING THEM AS MANY DETAILS AS POSSIBLE.,Light Transport Captain reported a NMAC with a drone at 7000 feet on departure in New York's airspace.,2017,04
248,201704,TEXAS,APPROACHING MATON INTERSECTION ON THE ILS 8R WE CAME WITHIN 100 FEET OF A DRONE AT OUR ALTITUDE. NO GREEN OR RED LIGHTS VISIBLE ON DRONE; ONLY A WHITE LIGHT. REPORTED TO ATC.,A320 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV while on the ILS Runway 8R at IAH.,2017,04
249,201705,ARIZONA,WHILE ON A VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 08 AT PHX APPROXIMATELY A 4 MILE FINAL AT APPROXIMATELY 2500 FEET MSL AT OUR 3 O'CLOCK POSITION THE FO REPORTED A DRONE TO THE TOWER. FO GAVE THE TOWER THE COLOR; ALTITUDE; AND POSITION OF THE DRONE. AFTER ARRIVAL AT THE TERMINAL WE GAVE THE SAME INFORMATION TO THE PHX AIRPORT POLICE. I NEVER SAW THE DRONE MYSELF AND NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN OR NEEDED. MORE INFORMATION SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC ON THE HAZARDS OF FLYING DRONES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY OF AIRPORTS.,Air carrier Captain reported a UAV flying near the final approach path to PHX Runway 8.,2017,05
250,201705,CALIFORNIA,ON DESCENT TO LAX AT APPROXIMATELY 7000 MSL NEAR CLIFY INTERSECTION ON THE IRNMN 1 ARRIVAL; I SAW OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY LEFT EYE AT AN ESTIMATED 1000 FT BELOW AND IN CLOSE PROXIMITY WHAT APPEARED TO BE A 'TOY HORSE' SHAPED OBJECT WHICH DISAPPEARED BEHIND US. I MENTIONED THE EVENT TO MY FIRST OFFICER AND REPORTED WHAT I SAW TO SOCAL APPROACH. AT THAT ALTITUDE I DO NOT BELIEVE IT WAS DEBRIS OF ANY KIND AND IT WAS NOT BALLOON SHAPED. I REPORTED THE OBJECT TO ATC AS A POSSIBLE DRONE.,A319 Captain reported sighting a possible UAV on descent into LAX in the vicinity of CLIFY intersection.,2017,05
251,201705,CALIFORNIA,THE SID HAD A 250 KNOT RESTRICTION WHICH NEITHER OF US CAUGHT WHEN BRIEFING THE DEPARTURE (I READ THE POINTS FROM CDU); FO VERIFIED ON SID PLATE. PASSING 12;000 FT; I GRADUALLY INCREASED SPEED TO 280. WE BEGAN DISCUSSING THE DRONE I HAD SIGHTED IMMEDIATELY AFTER GETTING AIRBORNE (DRONE WAS 1/4 MILE AWAY AT APPROXIMATELY 800 FT AGL). DURING CLIMBOUT; WE REPORTED IT TO ATC DEPARTURE; WHICH IS WHY I DELAYED THE SPEED INCREASE AT 10;000 FT. WE WERE GIVEN A STEP CLIMB AT WHICH TIME I HEARD ATC SAY; 'NORMAL SPEED.' ATC WAS STEPPING US UP UNDER ANOTHER AIRCRAFT. ATC BEGAN ASKING THE OTHER AIRCRAFT ABOUT ITS SPEED. I SUSPECTED A PROBLEM AND BEGAN SLOWING THE AIRCRAFT AND ASKED FO ABOUT 'NORMAL SPEED' AND HE TOLD ME IT WAS 'EXPECT NORMAL SPEED.' IT WAS THEN I REALIZED I HAD MISSED THE SPEED RESTRICTION AND PART OF THE RADIO TRANSMISSION. FO REALIZED AT SAME TIME. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; ATC QUERIED US ABOUT OUR SPEED WHICH WAS SLOWING THROUGH 270 AND WE RESPONDED WITH CURRENT SPEED AND THAT WE WERE SLOWING. WE MAINTAINED 250 FOR SEVERAL MINUTES WHICH ALLOWED OTHER AIRCRAFT TO OPEN UP TO A 12 MILE SEPARATION LEAD AT HIGHER ALTITUDE.,Air carrier flight crew reported neglect to note the 250 knot speed restriction on the SID and accelerated to 280 knots without being cleared to do so. Reporters cited being distracted by a drone while on climbout as contributing factor.,2017,05
252,201705,CALIFORNIA,AIRCRAFT X CHECKED ON DESCENDING VIA THE NEW STAR. I DESCENDED HIM TO 10000 FEET. ON MY INITIAL SCAN OF HIS ROUTE I DIDN'T SEE THE UNIDENTIFIED VFR TARGET (PROBABLY BECAUSE IT WAS TOO FAR EAST OF AIRCRAFT X'S PLANNED ROUTE OF FLIGHT. PRIOR TO OPTIMIZATION OF AIRSPACE AND PROCEDURES IN THE METROPLEX (OAPM) THESE ARRIVALS CAME IN ON A ROUTE ABOUT 5-10 MILES EAST OF THEIR NEW OAPM ROUTE AND THEY ALSO USED TO BE AT A HIGHER ALTITUDE WHICH KEPT THEM ABOVE MOST OF THE UNIDENTIFIED VFR AIRCRAFT LANDING AND DEPARTING L35 AIRPORT. THESE VFR AIRCRAFT GENERALLY TRANSITION AT ALTITUDES BETWEEN 8500-10550 FEET DUE TO TERRAIN AVOIDANCE.OAPM HAS FORCED THE SECTORS TO LOOK AT ABOUT 10-15 MILES MORE AIRSPACE AND THIS CHANGES THE WAY CONTROLLERS SCAN. IT FORCES YOUR ATTENTION TO BE PLACED AWAY FROM POTENTIAL CONFLICTS. PRIOR TO AIRCRAFT X REPORTING THE TCAS-RA I RECEIVED A CALL FROM MARCH APPROACH WITH UNNECESSARY COORDINATION. THEY WANTED TO KNOW IF I WANTED TO TALK TO A PREVIOUSLY COORDINATED AIRCRAFT SINCE HE WOULD BE MOVING EAST. HEMET RADAR (HEMR) HAD ALREADY COORDINATED A POINT OUT WITH THIS AIRCRAFT PRIOR TO ME TAKING POSITION SO THE SECOND CALL WAS REALLY UNNECESSARY; ESPECIALLY SINCE THE PLANNED ROUTE OF THIS AIRCRAFT WAS ALL IN THEIR CLASS 'C' AIRSPACE. WITH MY ATTENTION DIVERTED SOUTH OF AIRCRAFT X (BY APPROXIMATELY 35 MILES) I MISSED THE POTENTIAL CONFLICT. WHEN I GOT OFF THE LINE WITH MARCH APPROACH AIRCRAFT X REPORTED THE RA; THEY ASKED ME IF I WAS TALKING TO THE AIRCRAFT; I SAID NO. WHEN AIRCRAFT X REPORTED THE RA I DID NOT ISSUE TRAFFIC SINCE IT WAS ABOUT 1 MILE EAST OF AIRCRAFT X AND I DETERMINED THEM TO BE NO FACTOR SINCE THE TARGETS HAD PASSED AND WERE DIVERGING.THE CONFLICT ALERT ALARM DID NOT GO OFF UNTIL TARGETS WERE NO LONGER A FACTOR. CONFLICT ALERT ALARM WENT OFF AFTER AIRCRAFT X TOLD ME THEY WERE RESPONDING TO AN RA. IF THE CONFLICT ALERT HAD GONE OFF WITH ADEQUATE TIME FOR ME TO REACT I COULD HAVE TAKEN MEASURES TO ENSURE SEPARATION EVEN WHILE ON THE LINE WITH MARCH APPROACH. MY ATTENTION WOULD HAVE BEEN RE-ENGAGED TO THE CONFLICT IN THE NORTHERN PART OF MY AIRSPACE. HEMR SECTOR HAS TOO MUCH AIRSPACE. THAT COMBINED WITH THE OAPM CHANGES LEADS TO A VERY COMPLEX SECTOR. MARCH APPROACH NEEDS TO TAKE MORE AIRSPACE TO RELIEVE THE HEMR SECTOR OF THE LOW LEVEL VFR AIRCRAFT. WE ALSO SEEM TO BE WORKING MORE PICTURE AND SURVEY FLIGHTS ON THE WEEKENDS. CAN WE MITIGATE THIS BY NOT ALLOWING SO MANY AT ONE TIME? THIS AND THE RADAR FEED ARE PROBABLY THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES IN THIS TRACON AREA.DESCEND VIA'S COULD ALSO PLAY A ROLE IN THE EVENT; I UNDERSTAND THAT I DESCENDED AIRCRAFT X TO 10000 FEET; HOWEVER THE OLD PROCEDURES THESE ARRIVALS CAME OVER STOPPED AT 12000 FEET AND NOT DESCENDING TO 9000 FEET ALLOWING THE CONTROLLER TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AFTER MULTIPLE SCANS FOR THE HUNDREDS OF VFR AIRCRAFT THAT TRANSITION THIS AREA AT OR ABOVE 9000 FEET FOR TERRAIN. WE CAN ALL SIT BACK AND PLAY MONDAY MORNING QUARTERBACK AND I'LL BE THE FIRST TO ADMIT I MISSED THE TRAFFIC AND SHOULD HAVE TAKEN ACTION BUT; THE AMOUNT OF AIRSPACE HEMR AND NORR HAVE TO LOOK AT COMBINED WITH THE OAPM PROCEDURES ARE GOING TO LEAD TO MORE SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AND POSSIBLY WORSE.,SCT TRACON Controller reported not noticing a VFR aircraft conflicting with an IFR RNAV arrival due to focus required on a different portion of the airspace.,2017,05
253,201705,IDAHO,ONE RUNWAY (28L) OPERATION IN MVFR LOW CEILING CONDITIONS SET THE STAGE FOR A STRUNG OUT FINAL. THE CONTROLLER ON NORTH RADAR WAS WORKING THE AIRSPACE COMBINED. I WAS WORKING BOZEMAN; HAVING WORKED LOCAL; TAKEN A SHORT BREAK AND DIRECT TO BZN FOR BI-ANNUAL OVER-THE-SHOULDERS FROM MY SUPERVISOR ON THOSE POSITIONS. I HEARD NORTH RADAR ASKING FOR A SPLIT SO I WENT TO THE PHONE AND CALLED THE SUPERVISOR AND TOLD HIM NORTH NEEDED THE RADAR SPLIT. I NOTICED 4 PEOPLE WERE ON BREAK; ONLY ONE WAS A CPC; AND HE WAS ON BREAK 4 MINUTES. I WENT BACK TO BOZEMAN AND THE SITUATION AT BOISE DETERIORATED TO THE POINT NORTH CONTROLLER COULD NOT ANSWER LAND LINE CALLS. I BEGAN TAKING HIS COORDINATION CALLS AND FIXING HIS DATA BLOCKS; WHILE IGNORING MY OWN SECTOR (NOTHING WAS HAPPENING AT BZN). AFTER ABOUT 10 MINUTES A SUPERVISOR CAME IN AND TOOK BOZEMAN FROM ME SO I COULD SLIDE TO SOUTH. I GOT THERE; CALLED TO SPLIT PRINTERS; CONFIGURED MY SCOPE; BROUGHT UP THE FREQUENCIES AND TOLD THE TOWER WE WERE ABOUT TO SPLIT THE RADAR. I WAS READY FOR THE BRIEF BUT NORTH CONTROLLER WAS TOO BUSY TO EVEN GIVE A BRIEF. FINALLY; AS HE WAS MISSING MORE AND MORE TRAFFIC CALLS; CLEARANCES; CHECK INS AND LAND LINE CALLS I BUZZED IN HIS EAR AND SAID PRE-BRIEF COMPLETE; I'VE GOT THE SIA (SYSTEMS INFORMATION AREA); GIVE ME THE TRAFFIC. ONCE I'D ASSUMED THE SECTOR; I WENT ABOUT TRYING TO GET EVERYONE ON MY 'S' TAG AND CORRECTING DATA BLOCKS THAT DID NOT SHOW RUNWAY AND APPROACH ASSIGNMENTS. THE SR (SOUTH RADAR) AIRSPACE WAS A MESS OF PLANES WITH THE ADDED COMPLICATION OF A PARACHUTE DROP ZONE 10 NM SOUTHEAST AT AND BELOW 7100; 4 MILES IN DIAMETER. THE ORCHARD RANGE WAS HOT TO FL220 AND HAD TO BE MISSED. THE AREA IN WHICH TO VECTOR AIRCRAFT TO THE RUNWAY 28L FINAL WAS VERY TIGHT AND ALL ALTITUDES BETWEEN 7000 AND 13000 WERE BEING USED. AIRCRAFT Y WAS STUCK HIGH SOMETHING LIKE 10000 AND CHIPPING FOR LOWER. HIS DATA BLOCK SAID 'CAN' STILL FOR ARRIVAL FROM CANEK SO I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT APPROACH HE'D BEEN ISSUED; IF ANY. I DETERMINED IT WAS THE RNAV-Y 28L HE WANTED (MAKES SENSE AS THE RIGHT WAS CLOSED) SO I TURNED HIM TOWARDS THE IAF AND DESCENDED HIM. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; AS NORTH RADAR CAUGHT HIS WITS AND HIS BREATH; HE SAID; 'WATCH AIRCRAFT X IS GOING TO GET TOGETHER WITH AIRCRAFT Y.' I LOOKED AND AIRCRAFT X WAS ON A 100 HEADING ENCROACHING ON AIRCRAFT Y'S FINAL; OPPOSITE COURSES; BOTH AT 7000. I IMMEDIATELY TURNED AIRCRAFT X TO 180 AND WHEN HE ACKNOWLEDGED AND I SAW THE TARGET BEGIN TO TURN I DID A 'SPLAT-T' AND SAW 2.98. I WAS TUNNELED IN ON A FLIGHT OF MILITARY FIGHTERS TWICE THE SPEED OF THEIR TRAFFIC TO FOLLOW TO THE AIRPORT AND BROKE THAT TRAFFIC OUT TO THE SOUTH AS WELL AS FIXING DATA TAGS; SO I DIDN'T SEE THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS PENDING LOSS OF SEPARATION.AFTER RE-ESTABLISHING SEPARATION WITH 2 FLIGHTS OF MILITARY FIGHTERS AS WELL AS AIRCRAFT X AND AIRCRAFT Y; SHIPPING AIRCRAFT TO ZLC AND TOWER I GOT AIRCRAFT X BACK TOWARDS THE BASE TOWARDS NESLE FOR THE RNAV-Y 28L APPROACH. CONTROLLER ON NORTH RADAR STATED; AFTER THE DUST SETTLED; THIS WAS OUTSIDE HIS ABILITY; IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN SPLIT SOONER AND HE DOESN'T WORK ENOUGH BOISE RADAR TO HANDLE THIS LEVEL OF TRAFFIC. THE SUPERVISOR THAT CAME IN AND RELIEVED ME FROM BZN TO SLIDE TO SOUTH RADAR; HAD NO BREAKS ALL MORNING. HE WAS GIVING ME OVER-THE-SHOULDERS AND THE ASSOCIATED PAPERWORK. ON TOP OF THAT; THE BUSY NORTH RADAR CONTROLLER HAD A [AIRCRAFT] REPORT A NMAC WITH A DRONE SO THE SUPERVISOR WAS VERY BUSY WITH THAT REPORT AND PHONE CALLS; YET HE STEPPED UP TO GET ON POSITION AND ME TO SLIDE OVER AND HELP THE NORTH RADAR CONTROLLER; WHILE THE CONTROLLER THAT WAS DIRECTED TO HAVE MADE THE SPLIT LONG BEFORE ENJOYED A LUNCH BREAK.CONTROLLER THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME BACK AND SPLIT SOUTH RADAR 30 MINUTES PRIOR TO THE EVENT DISREGARDED THE ASSIGNMENT TO COME WORK RADAR AND ELECTED TO TAKE THEIR MEAL BREAK WITHOUT TELLING ANYONE. ONCE THE CIC TRACKED HIM DOWN THE CONTROLLER STATED HE WAS ON HIS LUNCH BREAK; SHOULD HE COME BACK NOW AND TAKE A MISSED MEAL BREAK OR STAY ON BREAK. HE WAS LEFT ON BREAK; SO I GET HIS DEAL. I RECOMMEND [CONTROLLER] GETS TALKED TO ABOUT MILKING A 45 MINUTE GROUND SESSION DEBRIEF; FOLLOWED BY A FULL; UN-INTERRUPTED; MINIMUM 30 MEAL BREAK WHILE HIS CREW MATES WORK SHORT. THIS IS A ROUTINE OCCURRENCE WITH THAT CONTROLLER. I ROUTINELY TAKE SHORT BREAKS OR EVEN GO STRAIGHT BACK TO WORK AFTER TRAINING MY TRAINEES DAILY. I REALLY TOOK ONE FOR THE TEAM ON THIS ONE. NOT COOL.,BOI TRACON Controller reported an unsafe situation where it was too busy to split the position.,2017,05
254,201705,NEW YORK,SHORTLY AFTER TAKEOFF FROM LGA RWY 04 AND AT 1;500 FEET IN A TURN TO 360 DEGREES; I NOTICED A RECTANGULAR OBJECT; BELIEVED TO BE A DRONE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LUNCHBOX; PASS WITHIN THE DISTANCE OF OUR WINGTIP; AT OUR ALTITUDE; ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF OUR AIRCRAFT.  IT APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING HORIZONTALLY.  A COLLISION WAS NOT DETECTED FROM THE COCKPIT NOR WAS THERE EVIDENCE OF ONE FOLLOWING A POST FLIGHT INSPECTION BY THE CAPTAIN. I REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO LGA TOWER AND DEPARTURE. THE SIGHTING LASTED ABOUT ONE SECOND.  NO CHANGE TO OUR FLIGHT PATH WAS INITIATED.  THE CAPTAIN WAS FLYING AND DID NOT NOTICE OUR ENCOUNTER.  THE CURRENT ATIS MADE NOTE OF UNAUTHORIZED DRONE ACTIVITY IN THE VICINITY OF THE AIRPORT.,CRJ First Officer reported a NMAC while departing LGA airport with what he suspected was a UAV.,2017,05
255,201705,TEXAS,EVENT HAPPENED SHORTLY AFTER DFW APPROACH HAD ISSUED INSTRUCTION DIRECT TKI FROM A POSITION OF APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES NW OF HQZ (VISUAL); 20 MILES S OF TKI (GPS). AT 3300 MSL; A RED/SILVER DRONE WAS SPOTTED JUST AS IT PASSED UNDER RIGHT WING. SEPARATION IS ESTIMATED TO HAVE BEEN 100 FEET. WE SPOTTED IT TOO LATE TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION. REPORTED TO ATC APPROXIMATELY 30 SECONDS AFTER EVENT WHEN FREQUENCY CONGESTION WOULD ALLOW.,PA-32 pilot reported a NMAC with a UAV at 3300 MSL 20 miles south of TKI.,2017,05
256,201705,TEXAS,I WAS WORKING THE FINAL IN A SOUTH FLOW. AIRCRAFT X REPORTED A NEAR MISS WITH A DRONE PASSING 100 FEET ABOVE HIM ON THE DOWNWIND INTO THE AIRPORT. AIRCRAFT Y WAS ON A DOWNWIND AND SLIGHTLY BEHIND AND TO THE EAST. IN DEALING WITH THE SUPERVISOR AND TRYING TO SPREAD THE WORD ABOUT THE DRONE INSIDE THE CLASS B AIRSPACE IN A PLACE THAT MULITPLE SECOTRS CAN USE THROUGH PRE-ARRANGED COORDINATION. I THOUGHT THAT I HAD DESCENDED AIRCRAFT X TO 3000 FEET; I TURNED AIRCRAFT Y WESTBOUND TO BASE LEG BEHIND AIRCRAFT X. I IN FACT DID NOT DESCEND AIRCRAFT X; I LEFT HIM AT 4000 FEET. WHEN I NOTICED WHAT HAD HAPPENED I DESCENDED AND TURNED BOTH AIRCRAFT AWAY FROM EACH OTHER. BOTH LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. MAKE FLYING A DRONE IN CONTROLLED AIRSPACE STRICTER PENALTIES. HAD THE DRONE NOT BEEN THERE MY WORKLOAD WOULD NOT HAVE GONE THROUGH THE ROOF TRYING TO KEEP AIRCRAFT AWAY FROM THE AREA.,D10 TRACON Controller reported an aircraft they were vectoring reported a near miss with a drone. The drone distraction and added coordination were cited as contributing to another airborne conflict between two manned aircraft.,2017,05
257,201705,UTAH,WE WERE ON APPROACH INTO SLC; I WAS THE PF AND CURRENTLY HAND FLYING THE AIRCRAFT TO A LANDING. AT ABOUT 14.5 NM FROM THE RUNWAY AT 8500 FT; I NOTICED A SMALL OBJECT APPEAR IN THE FLIGHT PATH. THE OBJECT; WHICH APPEARED TO BE A DRONE AS IT GOT CLOSER; PASSED OVER THE TOP OF THE AIRCRAFT WITHIN 100 FT. THE CAPTAIN NOTIFIED ATC OF WHAT WE SAW. THE APPROACH CONTINUED TO A NORMAL LANDING. DURING THE POST FLIGHT WALK AROUND; NO VISUAL DAMAGE WAS FOUND. SOMEONE WAS FLYING A DRONE WHERE THEY WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE. PEOPLE NEED TO BE BETTER EDUCATED ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF FLYING DRONES WHERE THEY SHOULD NOT BE.,CRJ-700 First Officer reported a NMAC with a UAV while on approach to SLC.,2017,05
258,201705,VIRGINIA,WE WERE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING DURING DESCENT INTO ROA AT ABOUT 13;000. WE WERE TOLD THERE WOULD BE SOME MODERATE TURBULENCE AND HEAVY RAIN.  NO THUNDERSTORMS WERE FORECAST AND METAR AND TAFS ALL LOOKED ACCEPTABLE. THERE WERE CLOUDS EVERYWHERE. SINCE WE ONLY HAD ONE PACK WE COULD NOT CRUISE ABOVE 25;000 AND THIS PREVENTED US FROM FLYING ABOVE THE WEATHER. WE WERE ASKED TO DESCEND A BIT EARLIER AND STARTED GETTING VECTORED AROUND TO AVOID WEATHER AND THERE WASN'T ANYTHING NOTICEABLE PAINTED ON THE WEATHER RADAR AND OUT OF NOWHERE WE WERE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING. THE TURBULENCE WAS BAD AND BUMPY TILL TOUCHDOWN. WHEN I INSPECTED THE PLANE AFTER LANDING; THAT'S WHEN I REALIZED WE ALSO HAD A BIRD STRIKE.,Air carrier flight crew reported being struck by lightning on descent to ROA. Evidence of a bird strike was also noted after landing.,2017,05
259,201706,CALIFORNIA,SOUTHBOUND ON DESCENT INTO PALOMAR ONE MILE PAST THE VISTA REPORTING POINT. SILVER DRONE TRAVELING OPPOSITE DIRECTION PASSED VERY CLOSE BY. NO TIME FOR EVASIVE ACTION. REPORTED INCIDENT TO THE TOWER CONTROLLER WITHIN ABOUT ONE MINUTE. TOWER ADVISED OTHER TRAFFIC TO BE ON LOOKOUT AND ASKED THAT I CALL TOWER ON LANDING. I DID AS REQUESTED AND THEY SAID THAT A REPORT WOULD GO TO THE FAA. NEVER RECEIVED A CALL BACK. TOWER DID ADVISE THAT A PERMIT REQUEST FOR DRONE ACTIVITIES WAS APPROVED FOR THE GENERAL AREA OF THE SIGHTING THAT DAY BUT THE ALTITUDE LIMIT WAS SET TO 400 FT; OVER 1;000 FEET LOWER THAN WHERE WE OBSERVED THE [DRONE].,C172 pilot reported a NMAC with a UAV on descent into CRQ airport.,2017,06
260,201706,CONNECTICUT,FOLLOWED IMSAFE GUIDELINES. WAS INTENDED TO FAMILIARIZE MYSELF WITH THE G1000. I ALWAYS TRY TO ADD ONLY ONE NEW THING AT A TIME TO A FLIGHT. A NEW PLANE; WITH A FIRST-TIME PASSENGER; TO A NEW AIRPORT; ETC SOUNDS LIKE A RECIPE FOR STRESS TO ME. SO I STICK TO ONE NEW THING. THIS FLIGHT; THE ONE NEW THING WAS THE G1000. I PLANNED TO TAKE A SHORT TRIP TO MY SCHOOL'S PRACTICE AREA; FLY AROUND; AND HEAD BACK. THIS WAS MY FIRST TIME SOLOING WITH THE G1000; AFTER A BIT OF TRAINING IN THE REDBIRD; ONE DAYTIME FLIGHT; AND ONE NIGHT FLIGHT. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY; SO THERE WERE A LOT OF PLANES IN THE AIR. I TOOK OFF FROM RUNWAY 29 AT BED; AND HAD AN UNEVENTFUL FLIGHT IN THE PRACTICE AREA. WHEN I HEADED BACK; I HEARD BED'S TOWER TURNING PLANES AROUND FROM RUNWAY 29 TO RUNWAY 11. I GUESSED (CORRECTLY; AS IT TURNED OUT) THAT BOS MADE RUNWAY CHANGES THAT FORCED BED TO USE RUNWAY 11; EVEN THOUGH THIS HAD A 10 KNOT TAILWIND. I COULD ALSO HEAR THAT IT WAS A PRETTY BUSY DAY; WITH SOME PEOPLE NEEDING TO DO 360S ON DOWNWIND. THIS IS ON THE BUSY END FOR BED; BUT WITHIN NORMAL. I'D FLOWN IN BUSY PATTERNS MANY TIMES BEFORE. I WAS GIVEN A STRAIGHT-IN LANDING. BUT I CAME IN FAST AND HIGH. THIS; IN ADDITION TO THE TAILWIND; MADE ME OPT FOR A GO-AROUND. I CAME IN FOR MY SECOND LANDING; WITH ONE PLANE IN FRONT OF ME; AND A PLANNED DEPARTURE WAITING ON THE GROUND TO GO BETWEEN US. WE WERE IN A RIGHT TRAFFIC PATTERN. DECISION POINT (MISTAKE): I TURNED BASE WAY TOO SOON TO ALLOW THAT TRAFFIC TO DEPART. I MISJUDGED THIS DISTANCE. I THINK THE TAILWIND WAS A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR; BECAUSE IT PUSHED ME CLOSER TO THE RUNWAY. BUT NONETHELESS; THIS WAS MY MISTAKE. I WAS JUST STARTING TO TURN BASE TO FINAL; HAVING TRIED TO SQUARE MY BASE. BUT I WAS COMING IN TOO CLOSE TO ALLOW THE TRAFFIC TO DEPART. THE TOWER ASKED ME TO SQUARE MY BASE; SO I TURNED BACK TO BASE; MEANING I WAS SLIGHTLY OVERSHOOTING THE RUNWAY. IN TURNING BACK TO BASE FROM FINAL; I BELIEVE I PULLED BACK TO STOP MY DESCENT; BUT I DID NOT ADD POWER. THIS MEANT THAT MY AIRSPEED WAS DROPPING BELOW 70 (MY STALL WARNER NEVER WENT OFF; BUT I WAS TOO LOW AND SLOW FOR COMFORT). I WAS GETTING ANTSY ABOUT TURNING BASE AGAIN; BECAUSE OTHERWISE I'D REALLY OVERSHOOT THE RUNWAY. BUT I NOTICED MY AIRSPEED WAS ALREADY GETTING LOW. I HAD A MOMENT OF INDECISION; BUT THEN DECIDED THAT AIRSPEED HAD TO BE MY FIRST PRIORITY AND I'D FIGURE OUT THE REST LATER. I PUT IN SOME POWER; BUT MY AIRSPEED WAS STILL GOING DOWN (NOT AS QUICKLY; BUT STILL THE WRONG DIRECTION). AT THIS POINT; I DID A 'GO AROUND' ON BASE. FULL POWER; BRINGING MY FLAPS UP. AT THIS POINT; THE TOWER TOLD ME I COULD BRING IT IN TO FINAL. AT THIS POINT; THE PLANE WAS STABLE; BUT I WAS STILL GOING A BIT SLOW FOR COMFORT; HAD NO FLAPS DOWN; WOULD HAVE TO BACKTRACK WITH A VERY TIGHT TURN TO GET TO THE RUNWAY; AND FINAL WOULD BE VERY SHORT. ATC HAD NO WAY TO SEE INSIDE MY COCKPIT; OF COURSE. BUT I FELT LIKE I SHOULD TURN TO FINAL. INSTEAD; I STUMBLED OVER MY WORDS SAYING I THINK I NEEDED TO MAKE A LEFT TURN INSTEAD. ATC UNDERSTOOD AND GOT ME ON A LEFT DOWNWIND. THE REST OF MY FLIGHT WAS UNEVENTFUL.THAT LAST DECISION POINT IS THE KEY DECISION POINT THAT IS CAUSING ME TO SUBMIT THIS REPORT. I WANT TO TRY TO GET YOU INTO MY MINDSET. THINGS WERE HAPPENING QUICKLY. I HAD A HIGHER-THAN-NORMAL WORKLOAD DUE TO ADJUSTING TO THE G1000. THE PATTERN WAS VERY BUSY. I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT LANDING IN A TAILWIND. I DIDN'T WANT TO MESS UP ATC'S SEQUENCING. SO I WANTED TO MAKE THE DEFAULT DECISION TO COMPLY WITH ATC. AFTER ALL; WHAT WERE THE OTHER OPTIONS IN THAT SCENARIO? I DIDN'T KNOW. I HAD NEVER DONE A 'GO AROUND' ON BASE BEFORE. WE TALK ABOUT UNSTABLE FINALS AND DOING GO-AROUNDS THEN; BUT WE NEVER TALK ABOUT UNSTABLE BASE TURNS (WHICH SEEM TO BE A HIGH KILLER OF PILOTS). WE SAY 'DON'T DO THAT'; BUT WE DON'T TALK A LOT ABOUT THE OTHER OPTIONS. WE DON'T TALK ABOUT INITIATING A 'GO AROUND' AT THAT POINT. WE DON'T TALK ABOUT TRYING TO JOIN THE OTHER DOWNWIND (I KNEW I NEEDED TO MAKE A LEFT; NOT A RIGHT - BUT IT WAS ATC THAT TRANSLATED THAT INTO 'JOIN LEFT DOWNWIND' AND GOT ME IN A SENSIBLE PLACE AGAIN). I AM CONVINCED THAT; HAD I TRIED TO MAKE THAT AGGRESSIVE BASE-TO-FINAL TURN; I COULD'VE ENDED UP IN A STALL-SPIN. THERE'S NO WAY ATC COULD'VE KNOWN THAT. I USED TO WONDER HOW BASE-TO-FINAL STALL-SPIN ACCIDENTS COULD BE SO COMMON. I NO LONGER WONDER. I AM CERTAIN THAT SOME PEOPLE HAVE DIED DUE TO NOT KNOWING THE OTHER OPTIONS WHILE OVERLOADED; SO THEY WENT WITH THE DEFAULT. AT THE END OF THE DAY; I MADE MISTAKES. THE TOWER HANDLED THEM WITH GRACE. I DIDN'T GET A NUMBER OR ANYTHING; SO THEY PRESUMABLY THOUGHT MY CORRECTIONS WERE REASONABLE. I DON'T THINK I CAUSED TOO MUCH TROUBLE THAT DAY. BUT THERE WAS A SPLIT SECOND WHERE I COULD'VE EASILY OUTSOURCED MY DECISION-MAKING (TO PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T SEE MY INSTRUMENTS) AND ENDED UP IN A LOW-ALTITUDE SPIN FOR IT.FOR ME; THIS WAS A USEFUL LESSON IN REINFORCING THAT I AM ALLOWED TO DEVIATE FROM ATC WHEN SAFETY IS AT STAKE; AND THAT ATC IS GENUINELY THERE TO HELP. AT BED IN PARTICULAR; IT AMAZES ME THAT THEY CAN HANDLE SO MUCH TRAFFIC - AND DIFFERENT TYPES OF TRAFFIC; AT DIFFERENT SPEEDS - AND SOMEHOW MANAGE TO KEEP US ALL SPACED. ESPECIALLY WHEN PILOTS MAKE MISTAKES; LIKE I DID THAT DAY! THIS REINFORCED TO ME THAT THIS IS A TEAM EFFORT - I CAN ASK THEIR HELP; BUT I CAN'T FORCE MY ROLE ONTO THEM. MY GOAL HERE WAS TO MAYBE SHED SOME LIGHT ON HOW A STALL-SPIN ON BASE-TO-FINAL MIGHT HAPPEN. I HOPE I HAVEN'T WASTED ANYONE'S TIME. THANK YOU FOR THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU DO; WITH COLLECTING THIS DATA TO MAKE AVIATION SAFER.,A general aviation pilot reported the challenge of approaching and landing at a busy airport particularly with unfavorable wind conditions.,2017,06
261,201706,FLORIDA,I WAS PILOT MONITORING AND WAS LOOKING FOR NEARBY VFR TRAFFIC INDICATED ABOUT 800 FEET BELOW OUR FLIGHT PATH WHILE WE WERE ON FINAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 06 AT RSW. AS I WAS SEARCHING FOR AIRCRAFT TRAFFIC; I NOTICED A LARGE DRONE OPERATING AT APPROXIMATELY OUR ALTITUDE; NOT FAR FROM OUR LEFT WINGTIP (LESS THAN 100 FT AWAY). THE CAPTAIN DID NOT SEE THE DRONE AND CONTINUED THE APPROACH NORMALLY AND WE WERE ABLE TO LAND WITHOUT ANY EVASIVE MANEUVERS. I REPORTED THE DRONE TO THE RSW TOWER CONTROLLER WHO ASKED FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT THE DRONE AFTER WE TAXIED TO THE GATE. THE DRONE WAS A LARGE; QUAD COPTER-TYPE DRONE.,Air carrier flight crew reported sighting a UAV while conducting the ILS Runway 6 at RSW. The drone was estimated to be within 100 ft of the aircraft; however no evasive action was required.,2017,06
262,201706,ILLINOIS,PASSED BY A QUAD COPTER DRONE OFF RIGHT WING TIP. IN SIGHT FOR ROUGHLY TWO SECONDS. AMAZED TO SEE ONE AT THIS ALTITUDE. WAS MONITORING CHICAGO APPROACH BUT CHANGED FREQUENCY TO MILWAUKEE APPROACH TO REPORT THIS AS CHICAGO RADIO WAS FAR TOO BUSY IN MY ESTIMATION. ONE PASSENGER (OF TWO) ON BOARD ALSO SAW THIS BRIEFLY BUT WAS NOT SURE WHAT HE SAW AS HE OBSERVED IT AFTER I HAD SNAPPED OFF THE AUTOPILOT AND TURNED LEFT BRIEFLY. DISTANCE ESTIMATED BASED ON OBJECT OBSERVED; FOUR HORIZONTAL PROPS; LONG SILVER AND DARK BODY WITH CAMERA MOUNTED ON END FACING OUR OPPOSITE DIRECTION. OBSERVATION TIME WAS VERY BRIEF. NO AIRCRAFT HIT; NO INJURIES. JUST A TAD ALARMING.,BE35 pilot reported sighting a UAV (drone) near UGN in very close proximity to his aircraft requiring evasive action.,2017,06
263,201706,NEVADA,CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH UAS. I WAS HEADS DOWN PROGRAMMING A NEWLY ASSIGNED STAR INTO THE FMS WHEN I SAW AN OBJECT THAT I ASSUMED TO BE A HELIUM BALLOON WHIZ BY THE LEFT SIDE OF THE WING IN MY PERIPHERAL VISION. THE PRIVATE PILOT I WAS INSTRUCTING IMMEDIATELY EXCLAIMED 'THAT WAS CLOSE!' HE STATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS SOME SORT OF MULTI ROTOR DRONE WITH A CENTER UNIT AROUND THE SIZE OF A BEER CAN AND HAD NEARLY HIT US. I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO ATC.,Corporate jet instructor pilot reported a close UAS encounter at about 7;000 ft near the LOOSN waypoint on the LAS SITEE 1 RNAV Arrival.,2017,06
264,201706,NEW YORK,I WAS PILOT FLYING AND DID NOT SEE ANYTHING. THE FIRST OFFICER THOUGHT THAT SHE SAW A DRONE ON SHORT FINAL.,CRJ-200 Captain reported the First Officer observed a UAV on short final to JFK.,2017,06
265,201706,NEW YORK,ON SHORT FINAL TO [LGA] RWY 22; WE OVERFLEW A QUADCOPTER (DRONE) AT 700 FEET AGL. I WAS PF AND THE DRONE PASSED UNDERNEATH US AT WHAT I ESTIMATED TO BE 200 FEET BELOW THE AIRCRAFT OR 500 FT AGL. IT WAS TRAVELING FROM THE SW TO THE NE UNDER THE NOSE OF THE AIRCRAFT.WHILE SEVERAL MILES OUT ON FINAL I NOTICED A WHITE 2 STORY BOAT IN THE EAST RIVER ABOUT 1 MILE FROM THE APPROACH END OF RWY 22 DIRECTLY ON THE CENTERLINE; AND NOT MOVING. I SPOTTED THE DRONE AT 700 FT AND REPORTED IT TO TOWER. IMMEDIATELY AFTER MAKING THE CALL; THE BOAT STARTED ITS ENGINES AND BEGAN TO MOVE OFF CENTERLINE AT A RAPID PACE. THE BOAT TRAVELED IN A NE HEADING. SHORTLY AFTER THIS; THE BOAT DISAPPEARED UNDER THE NOSE OF THE AIRCRAFT AND WE LANDED AT LGA.UPON LANDING I REPORTED WHAT WE OBSERVED WITH THE BOAT; AND AIRCRAFT DIRECTLY BEHIND US CONFIRMED OUR SIGHTINGS AS WELL. WHICH WAS THAT THE BOAT BEGAN TO MOVE IMMEDIATELY AFTER I REPORTED THE DRONE SIGHTING. I RECEIVED THE TOWER NUMBER; CALLED THEM AFTER WE PARKED AT THE GATE; AND WAS INFORMED THAT THE DRONE OPERATORS HAD BEEN APPREHENDED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.,CRJ Captain reported sighting of a nearby UAV while on short final to LGA Runway 22.,2017,06
266,201707,CALIFORNIA,WHILE ON DOGLEG TO FINAL FOR A VISUAL APPROACH TO 24R; I NOTICED A DRONE AT ABOUT 200 FEET DISTANCE ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE DRONE APPEARED TO BE A QUADCOPTER; BLACK AND ABOUT TWO FEET IN SIZE AND WAS REPORTED TO ATC IMMEDIATELY.,A320 First Officer reported a close encounter with a UAV while on a visual approach to LAX.,2017,07
267,201707,CALIFORNIA,PRIOR TO AN INTENDED FLIGHT FROM POC TO ZZZ; I PARKED AT THE SELF-SERVE FUEL PUMPS TO REFUEL. AFTER CHOCKING AND GROUNDING THE AIRPLANE; I WAS STUNG ON THE WRIST BY AN UNSEEN/UNIDENTIFIED INSECT. BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN STUNG MULTIPLE TIMES ON SEVERAL PRIOR OCCASIONS WITHOUT EXPERIENCING ANY ADVERSE EFFECTS; I WAS NOT CONCERNED; AND FUELED THE AIRPLANE. AFTER SECURING THE FUELING ISLANDS EQUIPMENT AND RETRIEVING A RECEIPT; I BEGAN TO FEEL LIGHT-HEADED AS I WALKED BACK TO THE AIRPLANE. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT; I BEGAN TO DEVELOP TUNNEL-VISION; SO I WALKED TO THE EMPENNAGE IN FRONT OF THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER AND PLACED ONE HAND ON THE EMPENNAGE AND THE OTHER HAND ON THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER TO BRACE MYSELF. MY FATHER WAS WITH ME; AND AT THIS TIME HE NOTICED I WAS VERY PALE AND ASKED; 'ARE YOU ALRIGHT?' I TOLD HIM; 'YES; BUT I HAVE A REALLY BIG HEAD-RUSH.' THAT IS THE LAST THING I REMEMBER. ACCORDING TO MY FATHER; I FELL FLAT ON MY FACE SO HARD THE GROUND SHOOK. I ESTIMATE THAT IS WAS ONLY ABOUT 3 OR 4 SECONDS FROM THE ONSET OF LIGHT-HEADEDNESS UNTIL LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS. I ESTIMATE THAT IT WAS ABOUT TEN (10) MINUTES FROM THE TIME I WAS STUNG UNTIL THE MOMENT I WAS ABLE TO DISCERN THE LIGHT-HEADEDNESS.HAD MY SYSTEM REACTED TO THE STING MUCH FASTER; AND I COULD HAVE EASILY PASSED OUT WHILE REFUELING FROM UP ON THE FUEL ISLAND'S LADDER. HAD I NOT DECIDED TO PURCHASE FUEL AT POC I COULD HAVE EASILY PASSED OUT DURING TAXI; TAKEOFF; OR FLIGHT. UNTIL THIS INCIDENT; I DID NOT BELIEVE I WAS ALLERGIC TO ANYTHING. IT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED TO ME THAT AN INSECT STING COULD BE A SAFETY OF FLIGHT ISSUE UNLESS THE PERSON STUNG EITHER KNEW THEY WERE ALLERGIC; OR HAD NEVER BEEN STUNG BEFORE. I WOULD ADVISE ANY PILOT THAT DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY ARE ALLERGIC TO INSECT STINGS TO DELAY DEPARTURE AT LEAST HALF AN HOUR AFTER BEING STUNG.,GA pilot reported being stung by an unseen; unidentified insect while fueling his aircraft at POC. Light-headedness and loss of unconsciousness occurred shortly thereafter and required hospitalization. He recommended at least a 30 minute delay for pilots who may be stung by an insect prior to any departure.,2017,07
268,201707,DC,WE HAD A BIRD STRIKE AT ROTATION TAKING OFF RUNWAY 19 AT DCA. THE BIRD HIT THE RADOME AND THE CAPTAIN'S WINDSHIELD. ON CLIMB OUT THERE WAS A LOUD SQUEAL AND WE SUSPECTED A WINDOW SEAL LEAK. WE [ADVISED ATC OF THE SITUATION] AND WITH CAPTAIN'S AUTHORITY; LANDED OVERWEIGHT. WE FOLLOWED THE APPROPRIATE QRH PROCEDURES. THE LANDING WAS NORMAL; TOUCHDOWN WAS LESS THAN 50 FEET PER MINUTE AND WE WEIGHED 147;000 POUNDS. A BIRD STRIKE FORM HAS BEEN SUBMITTED. THE AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE LOG (AML) WAS FILLED OUT APPROPRIATELY AND ADDRESSED BY MAINTENANCE; NO DAMAGE WAS FOUND.,B737-800 crew reported a bird strike on departure from DCA which resulted in a loud squeal and a diversion.,2017,07
269,201707,FLORIDA,I WAS THE PM FOR THIS FLIGHT. WE WERE ON A RADAR VECTOR FOR THE ILS 09 AT MIA. WE WERE TURNED TO A BASE TO INTERCEPT THE LOCALIZER. THE AIRCRAFT WAS AT APPROXIMATELY 3000 MSL; CONFIGURATION 1; GEAR UP. THE PF REQUESTED THAT I 'EXTEND A LINE' FOR THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE. WHILE I WAS 'HEADS DOWN' THE PF ASKED 'DID YOU SEE THAT?' I HEARD A MUFFLED THUD THAT SEEMED TO EMANATE FROM THE BOTTOM OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE PM STATED THAT HE SAW AN OBJECT THAT POSSIBLY STRUCK THE AIRCRAFT. HE WAS CERTAIN THAT IT WAS NOT A BIRD. THE AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS WERE CROSS CHECKED AND ALL INDICATIONS WERE NORMAL AND THERE WERE NO ADVERSE FLIGHT CHARACTERISTICS. ATC WAS INFORMED OF THE EVENT AND WE LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. AN ENTRY WAS MADE IN THE AML AND MAINTENANCE AND DISPATCH WERE INFORMED OF THE EVENT. THIS FLIGHT WAS RETURNING FROM AN INTERNATIONAL DESTINATION THEREFORE WE WERE NOT PERMITTED TO CONDUCT A POST FLIGHT INSPECTION.THIS EVENT OCCURRED DUE TO A RAPID CLOSURE RATE OF A SMALL INANIMATE OBJECT THAT MAY HAVE INTENTIONALLY OR UNINTENTIONALLY BEEN RELEASED INTO CLASS B AIRSPACE.,Air carrier flight crew reported a possible collision with a UAV on approach to MIA.,2017,07
270,201707,ILLINOIS,AIRCRAFT Y OPERATING UNDER A PREVIOUSLY COORDINATED BEACON CODE FOR AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING OPERATIONS APPEARED TO HAVE DEPARTED TIP SW BOUND APPROXIMATELY 16NM NORTH OF CMI. AT THE SAME TIME AN UNIDENTIFIED VFR TARGET WAS OBSERVED MANEUVERING 11-13 NM NORTH OF CMI. THE CEILING IN THE AREA HAD BEEN REPORTED AT OVC029 WITH A FIELD ELEVATION AT CMI OF 755 FEET. AIRCRAFT Y CONTINUED TO TRACK SW BOUND BEFORE CALLING EAST RADAR REQUESTING VFR TRANSITION THROUGH THE CLASS C AIRSPACE FOR AGRICULTURAL SPRAYING 7NM SW OF CMI. EAST RADAR TOLD AIRCRAFT Y TO IDENT FOR RADAR IDENTIFICATION. AFTER RADAR CONTACTING AIRCRAFT Y THE RADAR CONTROLLER OBSERVED THE UNIDENTIFIED VFR TARGET MANEUVERING IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY AND ISSUED A TRAFFIC ADVISORY. 'AIRCRAFT Y RADAR CONTACT 13 MILE NORTH OF CMI AIRPORT; ALTITUDE INDICATES 015. TRAFFIC IN YOUR IMMEDIATE VICINITY TYPE UNKNOWN; ALTITUDE INDICATES 015 AND APPEARS TO BE TURNING BACK EASTBOUND WITHIN 1 MILE WEST OF YOUR POSITION'. AIRCRAFT Y DID NOT REPORT THE AIRCRAFT IN-SIGHT. SHORTLY AFTER AIRCRAFT X; CALLED ON FREQUENCY AND SAID THAT IT WAS HIM OPERATING TO THE NORTH AND THAT THE [OTHER AIRCRAFT] WAS 'REALLY CLOSE'. AIRCRAFT Y THEN REPORTED AIRCRAFT X IN-SIGHT AND SAID 'IT APPEARED TO BE CLOSE'. NEITHER AIRCRAFT ADVISED OF ANY EVASIVE MANEUVERS AND NO OTHER AIRCRAFT WERE AFFECTED.ADVISE AIRCRAFT THAT WILL BE MANEUVERING LOW LEVEL VFR WHEN LOWERING CEILINGS ARE PREVALENT; TO REMAIN WITH RADAR FOR TRAFFIC ADVISORIES.,CMI Tower Controller reported a Near Mid Air Collision between an aircraft under their control and another VFR aircraft.,2017,07
271,201707,NEW JERSEY,WE WERE ON THE EWR ILS 4R APPROACH; IN VISUAL CONDITIONS. TOWER NOTIFIED ALL TRAFFIC; THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL REPORTS OF A DRONE AT 1000 FT NEAR THE LINDEN AREA. WE HAD AN FO; WHO WAS IN THE JUMPSEAT; WAS DEDICATED TO WATCHING OUT FOR THE DRONE. AT 850 FT; OVER THE REFINERY; ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT; THE FO SPOTTED A WHITE DRONE. HE SAID; 'OH MY GOSH THAT WAS CLOSE. THAT'S A NEAR MISS'. IT WAS WITHIN 100 FT FROM OUR AIRCRAFT. WE NOTIFIED ATC IMMEDIATELY OF THE NEAR MISS. FO IN THE RIGHT SEAT AND I WERE FOCUSED FORWARD AND NEVER SAW THE DRONE. HE ASKED IF TOWER NOTIFIED ANYONE ABOUT THE DRONE. ATC REMARKED THAT THEY HAD CALLED 4 TIMES. WE DID NOT NOTIFY DISPATCH IN A TIMELY MANNER. IT WAS A FEW HOURS AFTER WE LANDED THAT THEY WERE NOTIFIED.,B767 Captain reported that during final approach to EWR Runway 4R they encountered a drone within 100 feet of the aircraft.,2017,07
272,201707,NEW JERSEY,I WAS THE FLYING PILOT DEPARTING EWR MOMENTARILY LEVEL AT 15;000 BEFORE RESUMING OUR ATC CLIMB PAST COLTS NECK (COL) VOR WHEN I SAW A BRIGHT FLASH AT MY 2 O'CLOCK POSITION THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION. I LOOKED OVER TOWARDS THE BRIGHT AND HIGHLY REFLECTIVE OBJECT. I TRACKED THE PATH/TRAJECTORY AND IT APPEARED TO BE RELATIVELY LEVEL TRAVELING OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND BELOW OUR FLIGHT PATH. IT PASSED BELOW AND OUTSIDE OF THE RIGHT ENGINE NACELLE ABOUT MIDWAY OUT FROM THE LENGTH OF THE RIGHT WING. IT WAS HIGHLY REFLECTIVE AND SHIMMERING SO I COULD NOT GET A CLEAR IMAGE OF IT RELATIVE SIZE AND SHAPE. HOWEVER; IT APPEARED TO BE THE SIZE OF A FOOTBALL WITH A FAIRLY STABLE TRAJECTORY. I LOOKED BACK TOWARDS THE CAPTAIN AND THE JUMPSEATER AND SAID 'DID YOU SEE THAT?' THE JUMPSEATER SAID THAT HE DID AND THE CAPTAIN INDICATED THAT HE DID NOT. THE JUMPSEATER AND I SAID IT LOOKED LIKE OR COULD BE A DRONE. OUR ASSUMPTION. THE BEST I COULD COMPARE IT TO VISUALLY WAS A FLARE WITH ITS HIGHLY REFLECTIVE APPEARANCE BUT A SMOOTH (NOT RANDOM OR WOBBLY) LEVEL FLIGHT PATH WHIZZING BY US AT A CONSISTENT SPEED. I COULD NOT SEE ANY IDENTIFY FEATURES; SUCH AS ROTORS; PAINT COLOR; OR MARKINGS.,B737 First Officer reported a shiny object passed very close to the right engine while level at 15000 ft during an EWR departure.,2017,07
273,201707,NEW YORK,WHILE DOWNWIND FOR RUNWAY 4 AT LAGUARDIA AIRPORT; AT 4000 FEET; OVER THE HUDSON RIVER; ROUGHLY ABEAM CENTRAL PARK; THE FLIGHT CREW WITNESSED A DRONE PASSING THE AIRCRAFT OFF THE LEFT SIDE JUST SLIGHTLY HIGHER; PROBABLY WITHIN 150 FEET OF THE AIRCRAFT. IT WAS REPORTED TO THE NEW YORK APPROACH CONTROLLER AT THE TIME OF OCCURRENCE.,CRJ-900 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV in the vicinity of LGA airport.,2017,07
274,201707,SOUTH DAKOTA,ENTERING THE LEFT UPWIND FOR RUNWAY 16 AT THE LINCOLN COUNTY AIRPORT (Y14). AS WE WERE PASSING WITHIN THE CROSSWIND LEG FOR RUNWAY 34; A BLUE DRONE WAS SPOTTED. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS NECESSARY. HOWEVER; THE DRONE APPEARED TO BE TOO HIGH AND TOO CLOSE FOR BEING THAT CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT.,GA pilot entering the Y14 traffic pattern at 2;500 ft reported a near miss with a UAS which was too high and close to the airport.,2017,07
275,201707,TEXAS,AT 1100FT MSL ON LOC AND SLOPE FOR ILS 27 IAH I SAW A DRONE. IT PASSED OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE NOSE BY 15ISH FT. IT WAS WHITE WITH BLACK AND GREEN DECALS/PAINT. WE WERE CLOSE ENOUGH I COULD EVEN SEE A GOPRO TYPE CAMERA ON IT. IT PASSED OFF OUR LEFT WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. WAS SHOOTING ILS BUT IN VMC CONDITIONS. WHEN I SAW IT I ORIGINALLY SAID BIRD. MY FO LOOKED ON MY SIDE AND SAW IT AS I SAID IT WAS A DRONE. I REPORTED IT TO IAH TOWER ON 135.15. THEN LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT.,While flying an ILS approach in VMC; crew encountered a drone and reported the sighting to Tower.,2017,07
276,201707,TEXAS,I WAS VECTORED APPROXIMATELY 8-10 MILES WEST OF DFW AT AN ASSIGNED ALTITUDE OF 3500 FEET AND A SPECIFIC HEADING. I COMPLIED WITH GIVEN HEADING AND ALTITUDE. A FEW MINUTES AFTER CRUISE WAS ESTABLISHED I NOTICED A WHITE DRONE DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US. IT CAME AT US AT AN ANGLE. IT PROCEEDED TO FLY RIGHT PAST MY LEFT WINGTIP AT A HORIZONTAL DISTANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 50-100 FEET. THERE WAS NO VERTICAL SEPARATION. I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION BECAUSE BY THE TIME I SAW IT; IT WAS TOO LATE. AFTER THE NEAR MISS I CALLED THE APPROACH CONTROLLER AND TOLD HIM OF THE INCIDENT AND GAVE A DESCRIPTION OF THE DRONE. IT WAS WHITE; 4 PROPELLER; SQUARE BODY WITH A CAMERA MOUNTED UNDERNEATH.,PA28 pilot reported a NMAC with a UAV at 3500 MSL in the vicinity of DFW.,2017,07
277,201708,CALIFORNIA,ON VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 27 SAN; AFTER PASSING THE FINAL APPROACH FIX REEBO; AT 1200 FEET MSL; WE EXPERIENCED A NEAR MISS WITH A DRONE. THE DRONE PASSED LESS THAN 100 FEET BELOW THE AIRPLANE; JUST RIGHT OF THE NOSE CENTERLINE. NO EVASIVE ACTION TAKEN AS TIME DID NOT PERMIT. IT HAPPENED EXTREMELY FAST. WE REPORTED THE EVENT TO TOWER IMMEDIATELY. I REPORTED THE EVENT TO DISPATCH AFTER GATE ARRIVAL VIA PHONE. ALSO; THE SAN TOWER CONTROLLER CALLED ME TO DISCUSS THE DETAILS NEEDED FOR HER REPORT. SHE INFORMED ME THAT SINCE OUR INITIAL RADIO REPORT DID NOT INCLUDE THE STATEMENT 'NEAR MISS'; THAT SHE WOULD NOT BE FILING A NEAR MISS REPORT. I INFORMED HER THAT THE DISPATCHER AND I WERE FILING NEAR MISS REPORTS.,Airbus Captain reported a near miss with a UAV while on final approach to SAN.,2017,08
278,201708,CALIFORNIA,MADE CONTACT WITH AT DRONE AT 600-700 FT AGL. SPEED 180 KTS OVER TWITCHELL RESERVOIR 8 MILES NORTHEAST OF SMX.,GA pilot reported his aircraft was struck by an object while flying over Twitchell Reservoir at 600 AGL.,2017,08
279,201708,CALIFORNIA,THERE WAS A DRONE FLYING OVER PARKED AIRCRAFT AT MYF AIRPORT. EAST OF AND DIRECTLY OVER THE FBO BUILDING. WE WITNESSED 2 FLIGHTS OF THE DRONE AS WE WERE SECURING OUR AIRCRAFT AFTER COMPLETING OUR FLIGHT. THE DRONE WAS REPORTED TO THE POLICE DURING ITS FIRST FLIGHT; AND THEN AGAIN WHEN IT CAME BACK DURING ITS SECOND FLIGHT. UNKNOWN IF THEY LOCATED ANYONE CONNECTED TO IT.DRONE APPEARED TO BE ABOUT 150 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AT ITS HIGHEST; THERE WAS NO NOTAM REGARDING DRONE FLIGHT OCCURRING AT THE AIRPORT. THE DRONE MADE MULTIPLE PASSES IN AN EAST TO WEST AND BACK DURING ITS FLIGHTS OVER PARKED AIRCRAFT. I WAS ABLE TO HEAR THE MOTORS OF THE DRONE DURING BOTH OF ITS FLIGHT. THE DRONE FLEW OVER PARKED AIRCRAFT FOR ABOUT 5 MINUTES DURING EACH FLIGHT; WHILE AIRCRAFT WERE ACTIVELY LANDING AT THE AIRPORT AND MAKING RADIO POSITION REPORTS.THE DRONE HAD RED AND GREEN LIGHTS ALLOWING EASY VISIBILITY AGAINST A BLACK SKY TO SEE IT TURN AND TRACK IT AS IT MADE ITS MULTIPLE PASSES OVER PARKED AIRCRAFT AND THEN EXITED TO THE SOUTH APPEARING TO LAND AT AN OFFICE BUILDING.,Pilot tying down his aircraft reported sighting a drone flying over parked aircraft at MYF at night. No NOTAMs were in effect for these flights.,2017,08
280,201708,IOWA,AFTER COMPLETING AN AERIAL APPLICATION OF A FARM FIELD APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES SOUTHEAST OF LRJ AIRPORT; I WAS CLIMBING OUT TO THE NORTHWEST TO MY TYPICAL FERRYING ALTITUDE OF 500 FEET AGL TO RETURN TO LRJ. ONE MILE TO THE NORTHWEST OF MY TARGET LOCATION WHILE CLIMBING; AT 350 AGL I NOTICE BRIEFLY A WHITE OBJECT APPEAR IN MY LOWER RIGHT CORNER OF MY WINDSHIELD. I INITIALLY BELIEVED IT TO BE A SEAGULL AS BIRDS ARE RARELY WHITE THIS TIME OF YEAR; BUT WHEN THE OBJECT REAPPEARED UNDER THE RIGHT WINGTIP OF MY AIRCRAFT I NOTICED IT WAS IN FACT A WHITE COLORED QUAD-COPTER TYPE UAV. I ESTIMATE THE UAV MISSED MY RIGHT WINGTIP BY APPROXIMATELY 50 FT HORIZONTAL AND 20 FT BELOW VERTICALLY. I HAD NO TIME TO TAKE ANY EVASIVE ACTIONS PRIOR TO NOTICING AND PASSING THE UAV. AFTER DISCOVERING THE OBJECT WAS IN FACT A UAV; I CIRCLED THE FIELD TO OBSERVE THE UAV WAS IN A STATIONARY HOVER APPROXIMATELY 350 AGL ABOVE A FARM FIELD. I THEN OBSERVED WHAT I BELIEVED TO BE THE OPERATORS OF THE UAV INSIDE THE CAB OF A PICKUP TRUCK; LOCATED ON A SIDING ADJACENT TO THE FIELD FACING TO THE WEST. I DID NOT SEE ANY OPERATORS OR OBSERVERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE PICKUP. AFTER 2 ORBITS OF THE FIELD THE UAV; BEGAN A DESCENT TO THE ROAD ALONG THE PARAMETER OF THE FIELD; AND THE TRUCK DROVE TO INTERCEPT IT. I THEN CONTINUED MY FLIGHT DIRECT TO LRJ WITH NO FURTHER INCIDENTS.,Agriculture aircraft pilot reported a near miss with a UAV approximately 10 miles southeast of LRJ.,2017,08
281,201708,MARYLAND,I OPERATED A MAVIC PRO UAV AS RPIC (REMOTE PIC) ACCIDENTALLY WITHIN THE BORDER OF THE CLASS E AIRSPACE TO THE SURFACE APPROACH PATH INTO PHILIPS AAF (APG). THE PROBLEM AROSE DUE TO AIRSPACE INSPECTION THAT WAS NOT DETAILED ENOUGH. DUE TO MY DISTANCE FROM CONTROLLED AIRPORTS; I BELIEVED I WAS IN CLASS G AIRSPACE; HOWEVER; FURTHER DETAILED INSPECTION OF THE AIRSPACE AFTER LANDING THE UAV SHOWED THAT I WAS ACTUALLY OPERATING WITHIN THE EDGE OF THE CLASS E AIRSPACE APPROACH PATH. IT WAS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT TWO OTHER PEOPLE HAD CONFIRMED THAT THE AREA I OPERATED THE UAV IN WAS CLASS G AIRSPACE; HOWEVER THEY HAD EITHER NOT DONE AN AIRSPACE INSPECTION OR HAD DONE AN INCOMPLETE AIRSPACE INSPECTION RESULTING IN THE WRONG AIRSPACE IDENTIFIED. AS RPIC; IT WAS MY ERROR IN NOT DOUBLE CHECKING THEIR AIRSPACE IDENTIFICATION BEFORE OPERATING THE UAV. NO CONFLICTS WITH OTHER AIRCRAFT OCCURRED WITH THIS VIOLATION.,UAV operator reported operating within the borders of Class E airspace.,2017,08
282,201708,NEW JERSEY,WE HAD A BIRD STRIKE AT 6000 FT JUST TO PREFACE THIS EVENT.  WAS GIVEN A DESCENT TO 2000 FT AND SLOW TO 170 KNOTS; THEN TOLD TO FOLLOW A COMPANY 737 FOR A VISUAL APPROACH TO 4R.  THEN A FREQUENCY CHANGE TO TOWER FREQUENCY.  BEFORE WE COULD CHECK IN WITH TOWER; AND AS WE WERE LEVELING AT 2000 FT; WE GOT A TRAFFIC; TRAFFIC. I LOOKED AT THE TCAS AND SHOWED AN AIRCRAFT AT 500 FT BELOW US AND CLIMBING (ALMOST DIRECTLY BELOW OUR POSITION SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT ON THE 10 MILE SCALE) THEN WITHIN A SECOND WE GOT A CLIMB; CLIMB AND THE RED ENVELOPE HAD A VERY AGGRESSIVE CLIMB (NOT LIKE THE SMALL CLIMBS IN THE SIM FOR TRAINING); I CLICKED OFF THE AUTOPILOT AND AUTO THROTTLES AND PITCHED TO CLIMB OUTSIDE OF THE RED BOX.  I GLANCED AT THE TCAS AS IT SHOWED THE OTHER AIRCRAFT AT 300 FEET.  AFTER CLIMBING TO ABOUT 2800 FEET WE GOT A CLEAR OF CONFLICT.  THE FO (FIRST OFFICER) SWITCHED BACK TO APPROACH AND TOLD THEM WE HAD JUST PERFORMED AN RA MANEUVER FOR TRAFFIC.  ATC SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT THAT; OH YEAH; THERE'S AIRCRAFT Y THERE AT 1800 FT BUT I AM NOT TALKING TO HIM; AND SAID SOMETHING ABOUT THAT BEING A TOWER THING.  WE CONTINUED THE VISUAL APPROACH TO 4R AND LANDED WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.,B757 pilot reported a TCAS RA on final with an aircraft that the tower knew about but did not issue as traffic.,2017,08
283,201708,NEW YORK,ON SHORT FINAL; ILS RUNWAY 4; I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A BIG BLACK OBJECT FLY PAST THE AIRCRAFT. UPON ASKING THE FIRST OFFICER WHAT HE SAW; HE DESCRIBED IN GREAT DETAIL IN WHAT WAS AN UNMANNED DRONE AT ABOUT 500 FT AGL. AS SOON AS WE TOUCHED DOWN; WE INFORMED ATC OF THE AIRCRAFT AND INCIDENT.,CRJ-900 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV on short final to LGA Runway 4.,2017,08
284,201708,NEW YORK,ON DEPARTURE FROM RUNWAY 31L AT JFK WE WERE INFORMED BY THE DEPARTURE CONTROLLER OF A DRONE SIGHTING BY THE PRECEDING AIRCRAFT. THE CONTROLLER GAVE US A HEADING AND ADVISED US THAT THE DRONE HAD BEEN SEEN TO THE PRECEDING AIRCRAFT'S RIGHT AT 3000 FEET MSL. WE TURNED TO THE ASSIGNED HEADING (AUTOPILOT ON; BUT YOKE IN HAND; JUST IN CASE); AND WERE BOTH SCANNING OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT. I SPOTTED THE DRONE JUST BEFORE WE WENT ABEAM IT; ON OUR LEFT SIDE; AT 3000 (WE WERE JUST ABOVE IT IN THE CLIMB; PERHAPS 50 FEET HIGHER). OUR GEOGRAPHIC LOCATION AT THE TIME WAS APPROXIMATELY 3/4 OF A MILE NORTHEAST OF THE FORMER COAST GUARD AIR STATION. WE PASSED THE DRONE WITHOUT THE NEED FOR EVASIVE ACTION. WE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED ATC; AND I REMEMBERED TO PRESS THE FDR (FLIGHT DATA RECORDER) EVENT BUTTON TO SAVE THE LOCATION DATA. I LATER (WHEN TIME PERMITTED) ACARSED OUR DISPATCHER SO AS TO MAKE SURE THE FDR DATA WOULD BE PRESERVED. IT WAS A LARGE DRONE; AND APPEARED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF PARACHUTE/BALLOON ATTACHMENT. HAD WE MADE CONTACT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY BAD. THE REMAINDER OF THE FLIGHT WAS UNEVENTFUL. I WOULD NOTE THAT THE TURN GIVEN [TO] US BY ATC WAS ENTIRELY PROPER BASED ON AVAILABLE DATA. THE CONTROLLER HAD ONLY ONE DATA POINT FROM THE PRECEDING AIRCRAFT TO GO BY; AND MADE A BEST GUESS AS TO THE SAFEST COURSE OF ACTION. THE CONTROLLER DID GIVE US AMPLE WARNING TO BE AWARE; THUS HAVING US IN THE CORRECT POSITION TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION HAD IT BEEN NECESSARY. I WAS SOMEWHAT SURPRISED THAT DEPARTURES AND ARRIVALS CONTINUED. I WOULD HAVE SUGGESTED STOPPING THEM; AND SENDING UP A POLICE HELICOPTER TO LOCATE THE DRONE AND THUS HAVE A SPECIFIC LOCATION BEFORE SENDING LARGER AND FAST PASSENGER AIRCRAFT INTO THE AREA.,Air carrier Captain reported a close encounter with a UAV on climbout from JFK Runway 31L after being informed by Departure Control that the preceding aircraft had reported sighting a drone.,2017,08
285,201708,NEW YORK,WE WERE BEING VECTORED FOR A VISUAL 22L INTO JFK. JUST AFTER CROSSING THE SHORE OF LONG ISLAND AT 4000 FT HEADING 040; SPEED 250 KIAS ABOUT 2-4 MILES SOUTHWEST OF FRG AIRPORT; [THE FIRST OFFICER] AND I WERE BOTH HEADS UP BECAUSE OF ALL THE VFR TRAFFIC SURROUNDING THE AIRPORT. IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY. THAT'S WHEN SOMETHING CAUGHT MY EYE PASSING OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. IT WAS ONLY VISIBLE FOR ABOUT 3 SECONDS BEFORE IT PASSED ABOUT 100-200 FT BELOW US; BUT IT WAS QUITE CLEARLY A DRONE. IT WAS WHITE AND SHAPED LIKE A BOX. LOOKED LIKE ONE OF THOSE PHANTOM QUADCOPTERS OR LARGER. THE FIRST OFFICER DID NOT SEE IT. I REPORTED IT TO THE APPROACH CONTROLLER AND THEN CALLED TO GIVE A MORE DETAILED REPORT AFTER WE PARKED AT THE GATE.,CRJ-200 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV on a visual approach to JFK Runway 22L.,2017,08
286,201708,NEW YORK,I WAS WORKING THE POSITIONS OF LOCAL AND GROUND COMBINED. IN THE TOWER WAS ANOTHER CONTROLLER WORKING FLIGHT DATA CLEARANCE DELIVERY AND HE WAS THE TOWER CIC AS WELL. THERE WAS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FLOW PROGRAMS BEING UTILIZED WHICH CAUSED EXTRA WORKLOAD FOR THE FLIGHT DATA POSITION AND FOR MYSELF ON THE GROUND CONTROL FREQUENCY. ON TOWER FREQUENCY WAS 5 AIRCRAFT IN THE PATTERN WITH ONE OF THE AIRCRAFT BEING A DRONE REMOTE PILOTED AIRCRAFT. THIS IS NOT A NORMAL OPERATION AT SYRACUSE TOWER. THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC IN THE PATTERN IS 1 AIRCRAFT. NOT ONLY WAS THERE 5 AIRCRAFT IN THE PATTERN; BUT THERE WERE MULTIPLE AIR CARRIER ARRIVALS INTO SYRACUSE AS WELL AS ANOTHER DRONE. IN MY OPINION; FOR TRAFFIC THAT WAS ON BOTH THE GROUND AND LOCAL FREQUENCIES THERE NEEDED TO BE AN EXTRA CONTROLLER IN THE TOWER. UNFORTUNATELY; DUE TO OUR STAFFING THIS WAS NOT AN OPTION. THE ACTUAL EVENT THAT TOOK PLACE INVOLVED AIRCRAFT X WHO WAS IN THE VFR TRAFFIC PATTERN. AIRCRAFT X WAS INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW THE DRONE WITH ITS CHASE AIRCRAFT. AIRCRAFT X REPORTED BOTH AIRCRAFT IN SIGHT AND WAS CLEARED FOR THE OPTION. AIRCRAFT Y WAS OBSERVED LANDING WHILE AIRCRAFT X WAS ON A 2 MILE FINAL. AS AIRCRAFT X TOUCHED DOWN THE DRONE WAS TURNING OFF OF THE RUNWAY. THE DRONE DRONES HAVE TO TAXI AT A SPECIFIC SPEED WHEN THEY ARE ON THE TAXIWAYS AND THE RUNWAYS. THEIR TAXIING SPEED IS SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER THAN ANY FIXED WING AIRCRAFT. IN MY OPINION; THIS WAS THE LEADING CONTRIBUTOR TO THE RUNWAY INCURSION.I RECOMMEND THAT IF THERE ARE MORE THAN 2 AIRCRAFT IN THE PATTERN AND A DRONE; THERE NEEDS TO BE A STANDALONE CIC OR DECOMBINE LOCAL AND GROUND FREQUENCIES. AN INCREASE IN STAFFING WOULD HAVE ALLOWED FOR AN EXTRA 'PAIR OF EYES' FOR THE OPERATION. A STANDARD STRIP MARKING PROCEDURE FOR PATTERN TRAFFIC WOULD BE HELPFUL TO PROVIDE A VISUAL AID FOR INCREASED CONTROLLER WORKLOAD. THE DRONE SHOULD BE TAXIING AT A MUCH FASTER PACE ON THE RUNWAYS AND THEY CAN SLOW THEIR TAXI SPEED ON THE TAXIWAYS. A PROCEDURE SHOULD BE IN PLACE TO ADDRESS THE RUNWAY COMPRESSION THAT OCCURS WHENEVER A DRONE LANDS I.E. APPROACH SEPARATES AN ARRIVAL FURTHER FROM THE DRONE TO MAKE UP FOR THE TIMES IT TAKES TO GET THE DRONE OFF OF THE RUNWAY,SYR Tower Controller reported a runway incursion due to the MQ-9 UAV taxiing too slow and an arrival landing on the runway while the drone was still exiting.,2017,08
287,201708,NEW YORK,APPROACHING TWIN TANKS ON LGA RUNWAY 31 VISUAL. ATC ADVISED US THAT AIRCRAFT IN FRONT OF US SAW A DRONE. AS WE FLEW ACROSS TWIN TANKS I SAW A SPOT COMING TOWARDS US; BUT IT WAS A MYLAR BALLOON. FIRST OFFICER SAID SHE SAW A DRONE TO OUR RIGHT JUST ABOVE OUR ALTITUDE; SIZE ABOUT 5 FT ACROSS. I DID NOT SEE IT. AT DIALS AT 2500 FEET DRONE WAS ABOUT 2700 FT [AND] A FEW HUNDRED FT TO THE RIGHT OF US.,CRJ-200 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV on approach to LGA in the vicinity of DIALS.,2017,08
288,201708,NEW YORK,SHORTLY AFTER ROTATION FROM RUNWAY 4 IN LGA ATC ADVISED US OF A DRONE SIGHTING AT 1200 FT. AS WE CLIMBED THROUGH 1000 FT I KEYED THE MIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE ATCS ADVISORY AND A DRONE PASSED JUST ABOVE MY WINDSCREEN. I TOLD THE TOWER WE SAW THE DRONE AND THAT WE MAY HAVE HIT IT. APPARENTLY THIS WAS CONSTRUED AS WE DID HIT IT. I DEFINITELY COULD HAVE PHRASED THAT BETTER. WE DID NOT SEE AN IMPACT AND ALL SYSTEMS WERE OPERATING NORMALLY. I ADVISED DEPARTURE WE WOULD CONTINUE ON TO [DESTINATION]. THE FAA MET US AT THE GATE [AT DESTINATION] AND I MADE A WRITE UP IN THE MAINTENANCE LOG TO GET LOCAL MAINTENANCE TO DO A STRIKE INSPECTION. NO EVIDENCE OF A STRIKE WAS FOUND.PREVIOUS AIRCRAFT REPORTED THE DRONE AND WE WERE NOT MADE AWARE OF THIS UNTIL AFTER WE WERE AIRBORNE. I WAS CONDUCTING IOE WITH A NEW HIRE AND MY FOCUS WAS MORE ON THE FLIGHT INSTRUMENTS THAN OUTSIDE THE AIRCRAFT.,CRJ-700 flight crew reported a NMAC with a UAV climbing out of LGA.,2017,08
289,201708,OREGON,WE WERE ON FINAL TO RWY 28R AT PDX DESCENDING THROUGH 1;200 MSL WHEN WE SAW A BLUE QUAD-COPTER DRONE PASS OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. WE SAW THE DRONE JUST AS IT PASSED AND DID NOT HAVE TO MANEUVER TO AVOID. I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT IT WAS WITHIN A WINGSPAN DISTANCE; SO ROUGHLY 100 FROM US AT THE SAME ALTITUDE. AS PASSENGERS WERE DEPLANING; MULTIPLE PASSENGERS COMMENTED THAT THEY HAD SEEN THE DRONE AND WONDERED IF WE HAD SEEN IT ALSO. ONE PASSENGER FAMILIAR WITH THE AREA SAID THAT IT WAS NEAR THE IKEA JUST EAST OF PDX. I CALLED PDX TOWER AND DISCUSSED THE INCIDENT WITH THEM. LATER IN THE DAY I RECEIVED A CALL FROM THE PORTLAND POLICE DEPARTMENT ASKING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE INCIDENT AS WELL.,B737 flight crew reported a NMAC with a UAV on approach to PDX.,2017,08
290,201708,SOUTH DAKOTA,I PUT THE AIRCRAFT ON A PRE-PROGRAMMED MISSION WITH ALTITUDE SET TO FL270 AND AIRSPEED SET TO 83 KIAS.  THE ALTITUDE WAS NOT PROPERLY PROPAGATED TO ONE OF THE POINTS ON THE MISSION AND I MISSED THAT.  TURNING TO POINT 3; THE AIRCRAFT STARTED DESCENDING FROM FL270 AND WENT AS LOW AS FL254.  CENTER CALLED AS I WAS DOING A MANUAL TAKE OVER AND CLIMBED BACK TO THE ASSIGNED ALTITUDE FIXED THE MISSION AND CONTINUED OVER THE AREA OF INTEREST UNTIL A CREW SWAP OUT 2 HOURS LATER.THE LOCATION WAS APPROXIMATELY 20 MILES NORTH OF SIOUX FALLS; SD.,UAV Operator reported misprograming the UAV causing it to descend unintentionally.,2017,08
291,201708,VIRGINIA,WE WERE IN CRUISE FLIGHT AT FL400. THE WEATHER WAS CLEAR VMC. MY CAPTAIN STATED 'WHAT'S THAT' AND POINTED TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT; 1 O'CLOCK POSITION; SAME ALTITUDE. I LEANED FORWARD AND LOOKED PAST THE WINDOW POST BETWEEN THE R1 AND R2 WINDOWS. I NOTICED A WHITE BALLOON MOVING IN OUR DIRECTION. I STATED THAT IT WAS IN SIGHT AND THAT IT LOOKS LIKE WE ARE GOING TO MISS IT. THE BALLOON PASSED OUR RIGHT WING SECONDS LATER. I NOTICED A WHITE BALLOON WITH A SMALL BOX ATTACHED TO IT BY A CORD. IT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH FOR ME TO SEE THE CORD SWAYING BACK AND FORTH. IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY HOW MANY FEET IT MISSED US BY BUT I CAN SAY THAT IT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO SEE IT IN DETAIL AS WE QUICKLY FLEW PASSED IT. THE EVENT LAST SECONDS FROM THE TIME IT WAS SPOTTED. WASHINGTON CENTER WAS NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY AFTERWARDS. UPON LANDING WE REVIEWED THE REQUIRED REPORTS SECTION OF THE FLIGHT MANUAL AND DETERMINED THAT A REPORT WAS REQUIRED. IF MY CAPTAIN HAD NOT BEEN LOOKING IN THAT LOCATION AT THAT EXACT TIME WE PROBABLY WOULD NOT HAVE NOTICED IT DUE TO THE COLOR; SIZE; AND CLOSURE RATE.,B737 flight crew reported an NMAC with a weather balloon at FL400 over Virginia.,2017,08
292,201709,ARIZONA,STARTED USING A PREPROGRAMMED FLIGHT PATH. THREE MINUTES INTO A FIFTEEN MINUTE FLIGHT; RADIO CONNECTION WAS LOST WITH AIRCRAFT. ATTEMPTED TO USE 'RETURN TO HOME' FUNCTION AND MANUAL CONTROL BUT AIRCRAFT WOULD NOT RESPOND. AIRCRAFT FLEW BEYOND LINE OF SIGHT AND HAS YET TO BE RECOVERED.,UAV Operator reported losing radio connection with their UAV on a commercial photography mission. It has not been recovered.,2017,09
293,201709,CALIFORNIA,MY FO CALLED MY ATTENTION DURING OUR FINAL DESCENT INTO LAX ON THE HLYWD 1 ARRIVAL; CLEARED FOR THE APPROACH TO 25L; AND PASSING FUELR AT 9;000 FT. I LOOKED STRAIGHT OUT 12 O' CLOCK A LITTLE HIGH AND I SAW A BLACK OBJECT FLYING BY US A FEW HUNDRED FEET ABOVE US. I ASKED HIM; DO YOU THINK IT WAS A BIRD? HE SAID THAT HE THOUGHT IT WAS A DRONE. IT WAS TOO LATE TO DO ANYTHING AND NO STRIKE WAS SUSPECTED. WE REPORTED THIS TO THE ATC; WHO REPORTED TO OTHER PLANES. THE LANDING WAS CONCLUDED UNEVENTFULLY.,EMB-175 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV on approach to LAX at 9000 ft in the vicinity of FUELR.,2017,09
294,201709,CALIFORNIA,I DEPARTED HEADING TO JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT (SNA). PRIOR TO DEPARTURE; I CONTACTED GROUND CONTROL TO ARRANGE FOR AN ATC FLIGHT FOLLOWING TO JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT. I WAS ISSUED A SQUAWK BY GROUND CONTROL AND WERE TOLD TO CONTACT SOCAL APPROACH AT AFTER DEPARTURE.I DEPARTED AND ESTABLISHED TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION WITH THE SOCAL DEPARTURE. I WAS ACKNOWLEDGED BY THE ATC CONTROLLER AND WE WERE TOLD BY HIM TO CORRECT OUR SQUAWK. I FOUND OUR SQUAWK TO BE CORRECT AS ASSIGNED THEREFORE I SIMPLY RECYCLED THE TRANSPONDER. THE CONTROLLER APPEARED TO BE VERY BUSY AND WAS RUSHED TO ACCOMMODATE NOT ONLY THE INCOMING AND OUTGOING VFR AIRCRAFTS; BUT ALSO AIRCRAFT REQUESTING IFR APPROACHES AT THE TIME.THE BUSY CONTROLLER NEVER ADVISED ME TO CONTACT THE NEXT FREQUENCY NOR DID HE EVER ADVISED ME TO STAY CLEAR FROM CLASS C AIRSPACE. IF HE DID HE MUST HAVE BEEN STEPPED ON BY OTHER BUSY TRANSMISSIONS AS I NEVER HEARD ANY INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIM. AS SUCH; AND SINCE I HAD ESTABLISHED TWO WAY COMMUNICATION WITH THE ATC; AND SINCE I DID NOT GET ANY INSTRUCTIONS FROM HIM NOT TO ENTER CLASS C; WE PROCEEDED ON COURSE TO OUR DESTINATION; JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT.HOWEVER; SINCE I DID NOT GET A HAND OFF WHERE I USUALLY GET SUCH HAND OFFS; I BECAME UNCOMFORTABLE AND ATTEMPTED TO GET THE ATC CONTROLLER ATTENTION BY PERFORMING TWO 'RADIO CHECKS'. EACH TIME THE BUSY CONTROLLER IGNORED ME AND DID NOT REPLY. AT THAT POINT I DECIDED TO CONTACT JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT TOWER DIRECTLY. I EXPLAINED TO THE TOWER THAT I WAS ON FLIGHT FOLLOWING WITH THE ATC; BUT UNABLE TO GET THE CONTROLLER'S ATTENTION. JOHN WAYNE TOWER DID NOT COMMENT AT ALL AND ROUTINELY ACCOMMODATED ME TO LAND.UPON LANDING THE SNA GROUND CONTROL ADVISED ME TO CONTACT A SUPERVISOR REGARDING A PILOT 'VIOLATION'!FEW MINUTES LATER I CALLED A NUMBER AND SPOKE WITH AN FAA EMPLOYEE WHO DID NOT IDENTIFY HIMSELF. HE APPEARED TO BE UPSET AND ACCUSED ME OF ENTERING JOHN WAYNE CLASS C AIRSPACE 'WITHOUT TALKING TO ANYONE'!! IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT THE GENTLEMAN WAS TOTALLY CLUELESS AND UNAWARE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTS: I HAD OBTAINED ATC FLIGHT FOLLOWING FOR A VFR FLIGHT FROM TO JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT DIRECTLY FROM GROUND BEFORE EVEN GETTING AIRBORNE. I ESTABLISHED TWO WAY COMMUNICATIONS WITH THE ATC AFTER DEPARTURE AND AFTER BEING RELEASED BY TOWER; AND WHEN I ENTERED JOHN WANYE CLASS C AIRSPACE I WAS UTILIZING ATC FLIGHT FOLLOWING! AND; THE ATC CONTROLLER'S APPARENT BUSY AND OVERWHELMING WORK LOAD.I CALMLY AND POLITELY EXPLAINED THE ABOVE FACTS TO THE UNIDENTIFIED FAA EMPLOYEE ON THE PHONE. HIS ATTITUDE CHANGED SOMEWHAT AS HE STATED HE WILL HAVE THE ABOVE INFORMATION CHECKED OUT. HE ADDED I WILL HAVE NO VIOLATIONS IF FAA VERIFIES THE ABOVE FACTS. HE THEN DEMANDED MY PHONE NUMBER AND THE PILOT CERTIFICATE NUMBER WHICH I PROVIDED TO HIM RIGHT AWAY.AT THE END HE ADDED THAT THE VERIFICATION PROCESS HAS TO BE DONE BY ANOTHER 'TEAM' AND NOT HIM. HE WILL REFER ALL THE INFORMATION TO THE OTHER TEAM WHO WILL CONTACT ME. I REQUESTED THAT HE PRESERVES ALL [DEPARTURE] AIRPORT; JOHN WAYNE AIRPORT; AND ENROUTE ATC RADAR AND COMMUNICATION TAPES AND ANY OTHER EVIDENCE REGARDING THE FLIGHT AND THE ALLEGED INCIDENT WHATSOEVER AVAILABLE TO HIM.I EXPLAINED TO HIM THAT I WILL NEED THESE EVIDENCE SHOULD THIS MATTER ESCALATES TO A POINT THAT I WILL HAVE TO FURTHER EXPLAIN OR DEFEND MYSELF. HE INDICATED THAT HAD 'ALREADY' DONE SO.AFTER FINISHING THE PHONE CALL WITH THE FAA EMPLOYEE; I REMAIN PUZZLED THAT IF THE GENTLEMAN HAD INDEED EXAMINED AND PRESERVED THE RADAR AND COMMUNICATION TAPES; WHY WAS HE SO CLUELESS AS TO THE TRUE FACTS OF THE ALLEGED INCIDENT AND WHY HE ACCUSED ME OF ENTERING INTO THE CLASS C AIRSPACE 'WITHOUT TALKING TO ANYONE'?IT IS CLEAR THE OVERWHELMED AND BUSY ATC CONTROLLER DROPPED THE BALL AND FAILED TO TIMELY COMMUNICATE WITH ME OR TO PROVIDE ME WITH FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. IN ABSENCE OF CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS SUCH AS 'STAY OUTSIDE OF CLASS C AIRSPACE' MY OBLIGATION AS A PILOT WAS TO ESTABLISH A TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION WITH THE ATC BEFORE ENTERING CLASS C AIRSPACE WHICH I DID.THERE WAS NO VIOLATIONS ON MY PART. AFTER ALL I EXERCISED DUE CAUTION BY TAKING MY TIME TO REQUEST AND OBTAIN ATC FLIGHT FOLLOWING AND A SQUAWK BEFORE EVEN LEAVING THE GROUND IN MY DEPARTURE POINT. I THEN COMPLIED WITH THE REST OF THE REQUIREMENTS TO ESTABLISH A TWO-WAY COMMUNICATION WITH THE ATC UPON GETTING AIRBORNE. IF THE CONTROLLER WAS BUSY WHY WAS I NOT GIVEN AN INSTRUCTION TO STAY CLEAR FROM SNA CLASS C AIRSPACE UNTIL HE CATCHES UP WITH HIS WORK LOAD AND GET BACK TO ME? WHY EVEN I HAVE TO BE PLACED IN A POSITION BY ATC FAILURE TO DEFEND MYSELF AND WHY I WAS FALSELY ACCUSED BY THE UNIDENTIFIED FAA EMPLOYEE OF ENTERING THE CLASS C AIRSPACE 'WITHOUT TALKING TO SOMEONE'?AS PILOT AND A FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR MY AIM HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO FULLY COMPLY WITH ALL FAA REGULATIONS AND TO PROMOTE SAFETY AT ALL TIMES. HOWEVER; EVEN THE MOST EXPERIENCED PILOTS CAN MAKE A MISTAKE AND I AM NO EXCEPTION. IF I DO MAKE A MISTAKE; I WILL BE THE FIRST TO FULLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND TO FULLY TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT. THIS WAS NOT THE CASE! I DID NOT MAKE A MISTAKE RATHER I WAS SET UP FOR THIS INCIDENT THROUGH THE FAILURE OF THE SYSTEM THAT IS DESIGNED TO PREVENT AND AVOID EXACTLY THIS TYPE OF SITUATIONS; THAT IS VFR FLIGHT FOLLOWING TO HELP AND ASSIST PILOTS TO UTILIZE AND TO AVOID AIR SPACE VIOLATIONS.,General aviation pilot reported they may have entered Class C airspace without clearance.,2017,09
295,201709,CALIFORNIA,AT ABOUT 1300 MSL ON THE ILS I SPOTTED WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BIG BLACK BIRD AND TOLD THE FO TO AVOID IT. WHEN WE PASSED UNDER IT BY 50 FT WE SAW IT WAS A BLACK WITH WHITE STRIPED DRONE. WE TOLD THE TOWER AND CONTINUED UNEVENTFULLY TO LAND.,A320 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV on approach to LAX.,2017,09
296,201709,CALIFORNIA,WHILE FILMING SCENIC SHOTS OF LOS ANGELES OVER AND AROUND THE GRIFFITH PARK OBSERVATORY; I OBSERVED A DRONE MANEUVERING IN FLIGHT WELL ABOVE THE OBSERVATORY AND HAD TO MANEUVER BELOW AND CLOSE TO THE OBSERVATORY TO AVOID THE DRONE. I WENT INTO A HOVER AT 600 AGL SOUTH OF THE OBSERVATORY AND WHILE CLIMBING; HAD TO ABORT THE CLIMB ONCE AGAIN DUE TO DRONE INTERFERENCE. I HAVE HAD A NUMBER OF DRONE ENCOUNTERS IN THE PAST SIX MONTHS AND I BELIEVE IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME UNTIL A MIDAIR OCCURS. HELICOPTERS TYPICALLY FLY AT 500 AGL AND IT SEEMS THAT PRIVATE DRONE OPERATORS ARE NOT RESPECTING THAT AIRSPACE OR THE DRONE FARS.,Helicopter pilot reported sighting a drone over the Griffith Park Observatory while operating at 600 AGL. The pilot altered his climb to avoid the drone.,2017,09
297,201709,ILLINOIS,WHILE ON THE FYTTE ARRIVAL INTO ORD; WE HAD A NEAR MIDAIR COLLISION WITH A GLIDER. WE WERE AT 7000 FT DOING 210 KTS ASSIGNED. I LOOKED UP AND SPOTTED THIS BLACK SPOT FLOATING IN THE AIR AT OUR [12-1] POSITION. I THOUGHT IT WAS A BUNCH OF BALLOONS UNTIL IT MADE A RIGHT DESCENDING TURN. I REALIZED THAT IT WAS A GLIDER AND I TOOK EVASIVE ACTION. I PITCHED UP; TURNED RIGHT AND SHOVED THE POWER UP SIMULTANEOUSLY TRYING TO AVOID THE GLIDER. I DID GET A BRIEF STICK SHAKER ACTIVATION. FROM THE TIME I SPOTTED THE GLIDER UNTIL OUR PATHS CROSSED; IT WAS NO MORE THAN 5 SECONDS. WE GAINED ROUGHLY 400 FT ABOVE OUR ASSIGNED ALTITUDE AND SPEED INCREASED TO AROUND 250 KTS. WE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED A NEAR MIDAIR WITH A GLIDER AND OUR DEVIATION. WE RETURNED TO 7000 FT; SLOWED BACK TO 210 KTS AND REJOINED THE ARRIVAL INSIDE FYTTE. WE LANDED 9L WITH NO OTHER PROBLEMS.,B737NG flight crew and TRACON Controller reported a NMAC with a non-transponder-equipped glider at 7000 FT on the arrival into ORD.,2017,09
298,201709,MINNESOTA,OUR FLIGHT DEPARTED SIX MINUTES AHEAD OF SCHEDULE; DESPITE LOW CEILINGS AND HIGH WINDS. FUEL BURN AND TIME OVER THE FIXES WERE 'AHEAD' AS WE PROCEEDED AT OUR PLANNED ECONOMIC CRUISE AND IN CONTACT WITH MINNEAPOLIS CENTER. CENTER INSTRUCTED US TO TURN LEFT APPROXIMATELY 60 DEGREES AND TO REDUCE OUR SPEED TO MACH .74.  I FOUND THE CLEARANCE VERY ODD. AN UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT TRAVELING BEHIND US AT 38000 FEET HAD BEEN SLOWLY OVERTAKING US. WE COMPLIED WITH ATC INSTRUCTIONS AND WERE CLEARED BACK ON COURSE. I REQUESTED 'NORMAL SPEED' AND WAS INFORMED THAT WE COULD EXPECT TO REMAIN AT MACH .74 ALL THE WAY TO OUR DESTINATION.I THEN ASKED WHY AND WAS TOLD THAT IT WAS DUE TO SEQUENCING AND HIGH TRAFFIC DEMAND DESPITE CLEAR WEATHER AND WINDS FROM THE SOUTH THAT WOULD PRESENT NO PROBLEMS TO A NORMAL 'SOUTH' AIRPORT LANDING CONFIGURATION. I THEN ASKED ATC IF THE VECTOR AND THE SPEED REDUCTION WAS TO ACCOMMODATE THE AIRCRAFT AT 38000 FEET. A SECOND VOICE; FEMALE; CAME ON THE RADIO AND INFORMED ME THAT THEY 'COULD NOT PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION.' I REQUESTED A TELEPHONE NUMBER WITH WHICH TO REACH THE ATC FACILITY. INITIALLY; THE FEMALE CONTROLLER REFUSED TO PROVIDE ME A TELEPHONE NUMBER BUT; AFTER MY SECOND REQUEST; GAVE IT TO ME.WE LANDED AND BLOCKED IN.  CRUISE AT THE SLOWER MACH NUMBER; APPROXIMATELY MACH .04 BELOW OUR OPTIMUM SPEED; RESULTED IN AN 'OVER-BURN' OF 800 POUNDS OF FUEL VERSUS OUR PLANNED FUEL. PLANNED FUEL INDICATED 9;500 POUNDS REMAINING; ACTUAL WAS 8;700 POUNDS. THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC TO SPEAK OF AT THE DESTINATION; VISIBILITY WAS GREATER THAN 10 STATUTE MILES; AND THEY WERE LANDING VIA TRIPLE VISUAL APPROACHES. WE EXECUTED A VISUAL APPROACH TO WITHOUT INCIDENT. I CALLED THE CENTER AND SPOKE WITH A SUPERVISOR WHO SAID THAT HE WOULD COMPLETE AN MOR (MANDATORY INCIDENT REPORT) IN RESPONSE TO MY CONCERNS.I BELIEVE THAT CENTER NEEDLESSLY COMPROMISED THE OVERALL SAFETY OF MY FLIGHT IN AN EFFORT TO ACCOMMODATE THE OTHER AIRCRAFT AT 38000 FEET AND I BELIEVE THAT THE FEMALE CONTROLLER'S IMPATIENT AND HOSTILE RESPONSE TO MY REQUEST FOR INFORMATION ON A RELATIVELY QUIET FREQUENCY WAS A CLEAR INDICATOR THAT SHE WAS UNCOMFORTABLE BEING 'CAUGHT' DOING IT. IS IT REASONABLE TO BURN THROUGH 8.4% OF MY ESTIMATED FUEL REMAINING FOR NO APPARENT REASON? WHERE ON OUR 'FUEL LADDER' IS THERE A LINE TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS? HAD MY DESTINATION BEEN IMC AND HAD WE NEEDED TO HOLD; THAT SQUANDERED FUEL REPRESENTED OVER 13 MINUTES OF HOLDING. ATC IRREGULARITIES LIKE THIS ARE UNSAFE AND IMMORAL. INTENTIONALLY ECONOMICALLY DISADVANTAGING ONE AIRLINE TO THE BENEFIT OF ANOTHER IS ILLEGAL.,B737 Captain reported they were unnecessarily vectored off course and assigned a slow speed to allow other traffic to pass them.,2017,09
299,201709,MISSOURI,AT 4.9 DME FROM MKC AND AT 1900 MSL; THE PILOT FLYING NOTICED A LARGE QUADCOPTER AT OUR 10 O'CLOCK POSITION FROM THE FLIGHT DECK. APPROXIMATE SEPARATION WAS 500 FT LATERALLY AND 100 FT BELOW THE AIRCRAFT. DUE TO PARALLAX WHILE ON THE APPROACH IT WAS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE IF THE UAS WAS MANEUVERING BUT IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE INCIDENT UAS WAS NOT A THREAT AND NO AIRCRAFT APPROACH ADJUSTMENT WAS NECESSARY. THE INCIDENT LOCATION AND ALTITUDE WAS RELAYED TO TOWER.,Corporate jet Capatin reported a close encounter with a quadcopter UAS on approach to MKC.,2017,09
300,201709,NEBRASKA,I WENT TO SHOOT SOME FOOTAGE USING MY DJI MAVIC PRO (DRONE) AFTER BEING CONTRACTED BY A COMPANY. I CHECKED FLIGHT MAPS BEFORE FLYING TO MAKE SURE THAT I WOULD NOT ENTER CLASS E AIRSPACE DURING THE SHOOT AS THE CLASS E AIRSPACE FOR KEARNEY REGIONAL AIRPORT (EAR) EXTENDED DOWN TO THE SURFACE NEAR WHERE I WAS FLYING. DURING TAKEOFF AND THE FIRST 15 MINUTES OF MY FLIGHT; EVERYTHING WAS RUNNING AS IT SHOULD. AIRCRAFT HAD NO ISSUES; AND I WAS NOT IN CLASS E AIRSPACE; HOWEVER; AS I WENT TO CAPTURE THE EAST SIDE OF THE BUILDING; MY DJI GO 4 APP BEGAN WARNING ME THAT I HAD ENTERED CLASS E AIRSPACE OF THE KEARNEY REGIONAL AIRPORT. AFTER DISCOVERING THIS; I ENDED MY RECORDING AND PROCEEDED TO LAND IN A SAFE LOCATION OUTSIDE OF CLASS E AIRSPACE. I DID NOT EXCEED 60 FEET AGL DURING MY FLIGHT AT ANY TIME.I BELIEVE THIS PROBLEM RESULTED BECAUSE OF HOW CLOSE THE EVENT WAS TO CLASS E AIRSPACE AND ALSO DUE TO THE FACT THAT I COULD NOT ZOOM IN CLOSE ENOUGH WITH MY MAP RESOURCE (WWW.SKYVECTOR.COM). BASED ON WHAT I READ ON MY MAP; I BELIEVED THAT I WAS NOT GOING TO ENTER CLASS E AIRSPACE DURING MY FLIGHT.NO AIRCRAFT WERE HARMED. MY MAXIMUM ALTITUDE WAS 60 FEET AGL. THERE WAS NO RISK OF ANY AIRCRAFT COLLIDING. NO AIRCRAFT HAD TO TAKE ACTION TO AVOID A COLLISION.,A contracted drone operator reported he was alerted by the drone's sensors that he may have penetrated Class E airspace. He immediately terminated his video photography and exited the area.,2017,09
301,201709,NEW YORK,APPROXIMATELY 20 MM SOUTH OF LGA AT 3500 FT WE ENCOUNTERED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A DRONE. WE NOTICED IT AT OUR 1 O'CLOCK AND SLIGHTLY LOW AND IT PASSED IMMEDIATELY OFF OUR RIGHT WING. WE WERE UNSURE OF ITS IDENTITY AT FIRST; BUT THE FO REPORTED THAT JUST BEFORE WE WERE ABEAM IT; IT MADE AN IMMEDIATE TURN TO THE EAST AWAY FROM US. WE REPORTED TO ATC WITHOUT DELAY AND THEY HANDED US OFF TO THE NEXT FREQUENCY.,CRJ700 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV 20 NM south of LGA at 3500 ft.,2017,09
302,201709,NORTH DAKOTA,I WAS CONDUCTING TRAINING DURING A SESSION ON LC/GC. MY TRAINEE WAS WORKING AIRCRAFT X IN THE LOCAL TRAFFIC PATTERN ON RUNWAY 36. HE ALSO HAD AIRCRAFT Z IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN ON RUNWAY 36 AND AIRCRAFT Y WAS INBOUND ON A VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 9. AIRCRAFT X WAS IN THE RIGHT DOWNWIND AND TOLD TO EXTEND DOWNWIND; THE PURPOSE OF THIS WAS FOR AIRCRAFT X TO DO HIS OPTION AFTER AIRCRAFT Y HAD LANDED AND EXITED THE RUNWAY. THE MILITARY FLIES THE UAVS AND IS RESTRICTED TO ONLY FLYING IN THE CLASS DELTA. THE TRAINEE HAD TIMED IT APPROPRIATELY SO HE WOULD TURN AIRCRAFT X'S BASE PRIOR TO THE EDGE OF THE DELTA AND THE CONFLICT WOULD BE RESOLVED. THE PILOT OF AIRCRAFT X SAID THEY NEEDED TO TURN THEIR BASE EARLY (ABOUT 2 MILES FROM THE AIRPORT). THE TRAINEE RELUCTANTLY TOLD AIRCRAFT X TO TURN THEIR BASE. THE SUPERVISOR IN THE TOWER CAB IMMEDIATELY SPOKE UP THAT THE UAVS SHOULDN'T BE EXTENDED IN THAT AREA AS THEY 'COULD LOSE THEIR ENGINE OVER POPULATED AREAS' AND WOULD RATHER DO 360'S IN THE DOWNWIND OR ENTER HIGH KEY OVER THE AIRPORT. AIRCRAFT X WAS SHORT FINAL RUNWAY 36 AND WAS A CONFLICT WITH AIRCRAFT Y LANDING RUNWAY 9. THE TRAINEE INITIATED A GO AROUND TO AIRCRAFT X. THIS CREATED AN UNSAFE SITUATION AS WE DIDN'T KNOW THESE UNMANNED PLANES HAD THESE SPECIAL RESTRICTIONS. THIS SITUATION WASN'T BUSY OR COMPLEX; BUT IT CREATED A SITUATION WHERE IF AIRCRAFT Y NEEDED TO GO AROUND FOR ANY REASON; HE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN CONFLICT WITH AIRCRAFT X; WHO WAS ALSO GOING AROUND; THEY WOULD HAVE MET AIRBORNE OVER THE INTERSECTION OF RUNWAY 36 AND 9. TO MAKE IT WORSE; AIRCRAFT Z WAS IN THE RIGHT DOWNWIND ACROSS THE DEPARTURE PATH OF RUNWAY 9.I HAVE ONLY WORKED THE LOCAL UNMANNED AIRCRAFT FLOWN BY OUR MILITARY WHILE TRAINING AND ONLY A FEW TIMES; BUT I HAVE NOTICED THE EXTRA CARE THAT NEEDS TO BE TAKEN WHILE WORKING THESE AIRCRAFT. THESE ARE VFR AIRCRAFT IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN; BUT THEY ARE UNABLE TO SEE AND AVOID. THEY CANNOT FOLLOW TRAFFIC AND THEIR TRAFFIC PATTERNS NEED TO BE COMPLETELY CONTROLLED BY THE CONTROLLERS; THEIR BASES NEED TO BE CALLED TO FOLLOW TRAFFIC AND FOR WAKE TURBULENCE DELAYS. NOT ONLY IS THIS EXTRA WORK TO BE CONSTANTLY WATCHING AND TIMING THEIR PATTERNS; WE ALSO NEED TO BE MINDFUL IF THE AIRCRAFT GOES LOST LINK; WHERE IT WILL FLY THE SHORTEST ROUTE TO ITS LOST LINK ORBIT LOCATION. THIS COULD MEAN THE AIRCRAFT WILL IMMEDIATELY MAKE A TURN ACROSS THE AIRPORT; IF WE DON'T SEE IT HAPPEN SOON ENOUGH AND TAKE ACTION TO MOVE EVERYONE ELSE; WE COULD HAVE AN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT CUTTING OFF AND FLYING INTO ARRIVALS OR DEPARTURES FROM ANY ONE OF OUR THREE RUNWAYS. NOW MANAGEMENT IS TELLING US ALSO THAT WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP THEM AWAY FROM POPULATED AREAS AND THAT THEY WORRY ABOUT THEIR ENGINES QUITTING. I'M NOT SURE WHY THESE AIRCRAFT ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO LOSE AN ENGINE THAN ANY OTHER SINGLE ENGINE AIRCRAFT; BUT IF THEY ARE AND THE OPERATORS WANT TO REMAIN CLEAR OF POPULATED AREAS; THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE LOA THAT THEY HAVE WITH TOWER. THE MILITARY UNIT HAS BEEN VOCAL ABOUT WANTING TO FLY BOTH OF THEIR UAVS IN THE PATTERN AT THE SAME TIME. THERE ARE TIMES WITHOUT THEM WHEN IT IS BUSY AND WE DON'T HAVE MUCH ROOM IN OUR LOCAL TRAFFIC PATTERN. SOMETIMES AIRCRAFT NEED TO EXTEND AND SOMETIMES THEY NEED TO EXIT THE DELTA. THIS IS SOMETHING WE EXPECT ALL AIRCRAFT IN OUR PATTERN TO BE ABLE TO ACCEPT AND WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO MAKE EXCEPTIONS THAT JEOPARDIZE THE SAFETY OF OTHERS; WHETHER IT BE THE FLYING PUBLIC OR PEOPLE ON THE GROUND.,FAR Local Controller reported an operation involving a military UAV that was being conducted not in accordance with the LOA.,2017,09
303,201709,OREGON,I WAS WORKING THE NORTH RADAR SECTOR ON A RUNWAY 10 FLOW. WE HAD NOT BEEN ON RUNWAY 10 FOR SEVERAL MONTHS. I WAS ON THE END PART OF A BUSY SESSION INVOLVING A LOT OF WEIRD ISSUES INVOLVING A TFR IN THE DEPARTURE CORRIDOR AND A HEAVY AMOUNT OF VFR TRAFFIC. I HEARD AN AIRCRAFT CALL UP FOR FLIGHT FOLLOWING OFF OF SCAPPOOSE AIRPORT AND I DIDN'T HAVE TIME TO ANSWER HIM RIGHT AWAY SO I IGNORED HIM WITH THE INTENTION OF GETTING BACK TO HIM WHEN I HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. LOOKING BACK I SHOULD HAVE REACHED OUT TO HAVE HIM CONTACT THE FINAL CONTROLLER AS HE WANTED TO GO SOUTH FROM SPB AIRPORT. BUT AGAIN; WITH THE 10 FLOW IN USE; AND NOT 28; I AM USED TO WORKING THE SPB AIRCRAFT OFF OF SPB. I FINALLY RADAR IDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT X AND SAW HE WAS ALREADY IN THE APPROACH CORRIDOR FOR RUNWAY 10 AT PDX AND ON A HEADING THAT WOULD TAKE HIM ACROSS FINAL A FEW MILES BEHIND AIRCRAFT Y ON FINAL INTO PDX. I IMMEDIATELY ISSUED TRAFFIC AND THE AIRCRAFT REPORTED THAT HE HAD THE TRAFFIC IN SIGHT. NO INCIDENT OCCURRED AND I TRANSFERRED CONTROL TO THE NEXT SECTOR.THERE NEEDS TO BE A VFR CORRIDOR THAT TAKES PLANES AROUND THE PDX APPROACH AND DEPARTURE CORRIDORS. OR WE NEED AN AIRSPACE RECLASSIFICATION. LITERALLY EVERY SINGLE DAY SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAPPENS; AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE A SERIOUS INCIDENT OCCURS. MOST OF THE TIME THE VFR AIRCRAFT DOESN'T EVEN CALL ATC AND THEY JUST FLY ACROSS THE LOCALIZER AT AN ALTITUDE THAT PUTS IT IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH AN AIR CARRIER ARRIVING AT PDX. THIS HAPPENS DOZENS OF TIMES PER DAY. I DESCRIBE IT AS PLAYING 'FROGGER' WITH 737S. YOU ARE CONSTANTLY TURNING IFR JETS TO AVOID UNIDENTIFIED 1200 CODE VFR AIRCRAFT. IT IS RIDICULOUS AND ONE DAY SOMEONE WILL MAKE AN UNEXPECTED TURN DIRECTLY BACK INTO AN ARRIVAL THAT WE VECTORED FOR TARGET RESOLUTION AND IT WILL BE A SERIOUS INCIDENT. THE AIRSPACE NEEDS TO CHANGE AND SOON.,P80 TRACON Controller reported a recurring issue with unidentified VFR aircraft transitioning through the PDX Runway 10 final approach corridor.,2017,09
304,201709,PENNSYLVANIA,WE WERE CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF ON RUNWAY 27L WITH A TURN TO 230. IT WAS DUSK/NIGHT AS WE STARTED THE ROLL. EVERYTHING WAS NORMAL THROUGH 300 FT. I NOTICED WHAT I ASSUMED TO BE A BIRD UP AHEAD AT ABOUT 11 O'CLOCK. AS WE GOT CLOSER I NOTICED IT WASN'T MOVING; ALMOST LIKE A BALLOON. I HAD STARTED MY TURN TO 230 AS WE PASSED ABOUT 500 FT. I ASKED MY FO IF HE SAW WHAT I WAS SEEING BUT HE WAS BUSY CLEANING UP THE AIRCRAFT. AS WE GOT THROUGH 700 FT I NOTICED THE GREEN AND RED LIGHTS ON WHAT I NOW FIGURED WAS A DRONE. WE ENDED UP PASSING THE DRONE AROUND 200 FT AWAY AND IT APPEARED TO BE AROUND 600 FT AGL. AT ITS CLOSEST; I COULD MAKE OUT 2 ROTORS AND 2 BRIGHT LIGHTS; ONE RED AND ONE GREEN. IT WAS PAINTED BLACK.ONCE WE WERE CHECKED IN WITH DEPARTURE; THE FO [NOTIFIED] THEM OF THE DRONE. WE GAVE THEM ALL THE INFO THEY REQUESTED AND THEY ASKED US TO CALL THEM AFTER LANDING. AFTER LANDING; I CALLED ATC AND ANSWERED ALL OF THEIR QUESTIONS. IT APPEARED LIKE A BLACK BIRD ORIGINALLY. SO WE TREATED AS YOU WOULD A BIRD. WE KEPT THE DISTANCE AND CONTINUED AS ASSIGNED. IT WASN'T UNTIL WE GOT CLOSER THAT WE NOTICED THE DIFFERENT ATTRIBUTES OF THE DRONE. WE WERE ALWAYS A SAFE DISTANCE AWAY. WE CONTINUED THE FLIGHT AFTER NOTIFYING ATC.,EMB-145 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV shortly after takeoff from PHL.,2017,09
305,201709,SOUTH CAROLINA,I WAS BUSY AND WORKING WEST RADAR. I GAVE A SEQUENCE TO EAST RADAR ON AIRCRAFT X TO RUNWAY 4 AT GSP. WE WERE BOTH BUSY AND THE EAST CONTROLLER HAD BEEN CERTIFIED FOR 1 WEEK. I DID NOT NOTICE A VFR ON A 1200 CODE DEPART GMU TO THE SOUTHEAST. THE EAST CONTROLLER WAS BUSY; BUT HE NOTICED THE GMU DEPARTURE AND ISSUED VECTORS TO AIRCRAFT X AND HELD THE PLANE AT 3;000 MSL. FROM WHAT I CAN TELL HE DID A REALLY GREAT JOB.ONLY ABOUT 20 MINUTES BEFORE THIS I HAD AN AIRCRAFT ON ARRIVAL TO RUNWAY 4 AT GSP. THERE WAS ALSO A VFR THAT DEPARTED GMU. FOR WHATEVER REASON (THE GMU CONTROLLER OR THE PILOT); IT WAS THE BEST DECONFLICTION I HAVE SEEN IN THIS SCENARIO FROM THE VFR. THE VFR CROSSED GSP RUNWAY 4 FINAL 8 OR 9 MILES FROM THE RUNWAY; WHICH MADE IT A NON EVENT FOR MY TRAFFIC ON THE BASE.I WAS RELIEVED SHORTLY AFTER THE AIRCRAFT X EVENT. I WENT TO THE TOWER BEFORE MY BREAK TO SUGGEST A RUNWAY CHANGE. I THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE A LOT MORE GMU DEPARTURES TO THE SOUTHEAST BECAUSE OF A FLY IN AT SC00. I HAD RATHER HAVE THE UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT UNDER A DEPARTURE THAN AN ARRIVAL. THE TOWER INITIATED A RUNWAY CHANGE.RECOMMENDATION: THIS IS A TERRIBLE SITUATION BECAUSE IT IS NOT OBVIOUS THAT IT IS GETTING READY TO HAPPEN. ONCE YOU REALIZE IT; YOUR OPTIONS ARE: AN UNSTABLE APPROACH; TCAS RA; OR VECTORS AROUND FOR A RE-SEQUENCE. THERE ARE ALSO WAKE TURBULENCE ISSUES. THE GSP AIR TRAFFIC MANAGER (ATM) SUGGESTED A VFR FIX ON THE GSP RUNWAY 4 FINAL. THE VFR'S WOULD BE REQUIRED TO CROSS AT OR OUTSIDE OF IT AND AT OR BELOW A CERTAIN ALTITUDE. WE KNOW THIS IS A PROBLEM. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FIX IT BEFORE THE PROBLEM CHANGES TO DISASTER.,GSP TRACON Controller reported an occurrence which routinely happens of VFR aircraft not in communication with ATC departing one airport into the final approach course traffic of another airport.,2017,09
306,201710,CALIFORNIA,I WAS FLYING ON A VFR FLIGHT PLAN TO CMA. I WAS IN VFR CONDITIONS WITH UNLIMITED CEILING AND VISIBILITY. I WAS AT 4000 FEET APPROACHING JUREX INTERSECTION. I WAS GIVEN A HAND-OFF WITH SOCAL TO POINT MUGU APPROACH. I CHANGED FREQUENCY AT WHICH TIME I SAW A FLORESCENT ORANGE FLASH GO BY THE AIRCRAFT OFF MY RIGHT WING AT MY ALTITUDE. I SAW THE FLASH OF COLOR PROBABLY LESS THAN ONE SECOND AND WAS NOT ABLE TO FOCUS ON THE OBJECT. IT WAS NOT AN AIRCRAFT AND WAS SMALL IN SIZE. THE FLASH I SAW WAS A NARROW HORIZONTAL SHAPE. THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC ADVISORY BY ATC. THIS NEAR MISS OCCURRED JUST PRIOR TO MY RIGHT TURN ONTO THE FINAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 26 AT CMA. I THOUGHT ABOUT ADVISING APPROACH OF THE NEAR MISS WITH A DRONE BUT DIDN'T DUE TO MY WORK LOAD AT THE TIME OF THE APPROACH AND THE THREAT HAD PASSED. FRANKLY AT THE TIME I COULDN'T THINK OF THE WORD DRONE. I AM NOW NOT A FAN OF DRONES WHICH COULD BE CATASTROPHIC TO AIRCRAFT.,SR22 pilot reported a NMAC with a drone while on a visual approach to CMA at 4000 ft.,2017,10
307,201710,CALIFORNIA,AFTER TAKEOFF AT ABOUT 800 FT AND BEFORE RAISING FLAPS; WE STRUCK A FLOCK OF APPROXIMATELY 20 BIRDS. WE PROBABLY HIT ABOUT 6 OF THEM. BOTH WINDSCREENS WERE PARTIALLY OBSCURED AND THE 'WINDSHEAR' ALERT SOUNDED. THE BIRDS WERE SPOTTED JUST BEFORE IMPACT SO IT WAS OBVIOUS THAT WE HADN'T ENCOUNTERED WINDSHEAR. AFTER THE ENCOUNTER; THE CAPTAIN'S AIRSPEED WAS SHOWING APPROXIMATELY 80 KNOTS WHEN THE STANDBY AND FIRST OFFICER'S AIRSPEED READ APPROXIMATELY 190 KTS. CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE FIRST OFFICER WHO CONTINUED THE CLIMB AND RETRACTED FLAPS ON SCHEDULE. ATC WAS NOTIFIED OF THE BIRD STRIKE AND LOCATION. WE REQUESTED AN INITIAL CLIMB TO 10;000 FT AND ADVISED THEM THERE WERE SOME SYSTEMS AFFECTED BY THE BIRD STRIKE AND THAT WE WOULD BE WORKING THE PROBLEM. THE FLIGHT DIRECTORS WERE NOT WORKING; AND LNAV AND VNAV SEEMED UNRELIABLE. THE FIRST OFFICER HAND FLEW THE AIRPLANE. THE AUTOPILOT WAS LATER ENGAGED AS WE DETERMINED THAT IT WORKED IN 'R.' THE FIRST OFFICER FLEW THE AIRPLANE AND HANDLED MOST OF THE RADIO WORK WITH THE SECOND OBSERVER BACKING HIM UP. THE CAPTAIN AND FIRST OBSERVER ACCOMPLISHED THE 'IAS DISAGREE OR AIRSPEED UNRELIABLE' CHECKLIST. THIS BROUGHT BACK THE CAPTAIN'S AIRSPEED INDICATORS TO NORMAL. AN ANALYSIS OF THE AIRCRAFT'S CONDITION AND EQUIPMENT STATUS WAS DONE. THE FLIGHT DIRECTORS HAD BIASED FROM VIEW; LNAV WAS INOPERATIVE; THE AIRPLANE SEEMED TO TURN SLOWER THAN NORMAL; AND WE DID NOT KNOW WHAT OTHER DAMAGE HAD BEEN DONE. WE REQUEST ATC TO PROVIDE VECTORS FOR US TO PREPARE FOR DUMPING AND USED SATCOM FOR CONFERENCE CALL WITH DISPATCH AND MAINTENANCE. WE DID NOT FEEL IT WAS SAFE OR WISE TO CONTINUE TO DESTINATION SO BEGAN PREPARATION TO RETURN TO SFO. THE AIRCRAFT WEIGHT WAS APPROXIMATELY 830;000 LBS SO WE DUMPED APPROXIMATELY 200;000 LBS OF FUEL TO BRING WEIGHT DOWN TO 630;000 LBSIN PREPARATION FOR LANDING BACK IN SFO. LOGBOOK ENTRIES; APPROACH PREPARATION; BRIEFINGS; AND CHECKLISTS WERE ACCOMPLISHED DURING DUMPING WHICH TOOK APPROXIMATELY 45 MINS. THE BDEGA 2 ARRIVAL AND ILS RUNWAY 28R WERE FLOWN BY THE CAPTAIN USING THE AUTOPILOT IN HDG SEL AND FLCH; THEN GS AND LOC TO APPROXIMATELY 1200 FT; THEN HAND FLOWN FOR LANDING WITH FLAPS 30.,Air carrier flight crew reported encountering multiple bird strikes shortly after takeoff from SFO resulting in spurious flight instrument indications. After dumping fuel; a return to the departure airport was safely accomplished.,2017,10
308,201710,CALIFORNIA,AIRCRAFT X WAS DIRECT WUVON DESCENDING TO 4;000 TO INTERCEPT THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE TO EVENTUALLY GET THE FIELD IN SIGHT AND CLEARED FOR A VISUAL APPROACH. AIRCRAFT Y WAS ABOUT 5 MILES IN TRAIL DIRECT FRNNY GOING SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN AIRCRAFT X. AS AIRCRAFT X WAS APPROACHING THE FINAL; I OBSERVED THAT THERE WAS AN UNIDENTIFIED VFR AIRCRAFT AT THEIR 11 O'CLOCK NORTHEAST BOUND CLIMBING OUT OF 3;300 FEET. I INSTRUCTED AIRCRAFT X TO AMEND THEIR ALTITUDE TO 4;500 FOR TRAFFIC. VFR TRAFFIC AND AIRCRAFT X WERE GOING TO MERGE SO I TURNED AIRCRAFT X TO GO BEHIND THE TRAFFIC. THIS IN TURN CAUSED AIRCRAFT X AT 4;500 TO CROSS THE PATH OF AIRCRAFT Y WHO WAS LEVEL AT 5;000.IN THE PROCESS OF RECOVERING SEPARATION BETWEEN AIRCRAFT X AND AIRCRAFT Y; AIRCRAFT X DESCENDING TO 5;000 MAY HAVE PENETRATED NILES AIRSPACE. AIRCRAFT X WAS TURNED TO A HEADING OF 340 TO CONTINUE THEIR DESCENT AND AWAY FROM NILES AIRSPACE.I SHOULD HAVE JUST TURNED AIRCRAFT X NORTHBOUND; CLIMBED AND POSSIBLY RESEQUENCED THEM WHEN THE VFR TARGET FURTHER BECAME A FACTOR. WITH AIRCRAFT Y 5SM IN TRAIL AND KEEPING HIS SPEED AT A HIGHER VELOCITY; IT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE EASIEST OPTION.,A TRACON Controller reported vectoring an aircraft off their approach to avoid unidentified VFR traffic lost required spacing with the arriving in trail traffic.,2017,10
309,201710,CALIFORNIA,ESTABLISHED ON VOR-A INTO SMO; BETWEEN BEVEY AND WURUD INTERSECTIONS; 1900 TO 2000; PM SAW TWO DRONES WHIZ BY THE WINDSHIELD 15-20 FT ON BOTH SIDES; AND CALLED THEM OUT. THE EVENT WAS OVER SO QUICKLY THAT I DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO LOOK UP FROM INSTRUMENTS AND ACTUALLY SEE THE DRONES. SOMEBODY WAS PLAYING WITH THEIR DRONES TOO CLOSE TO AN AIRPORT AND TOO HIGH. IT IS A LITTLE SCARY TO THINK THAT THESE DRONES COULD HAVE BEEN THERE INTENTIONALLY; AND PERHAPS EVEN WITH A SMALL PACK OF EXPLOSIVES STRAPPED TO THEM. THERE WAS NO TIME TO REACT. WE WERE JUST LUCKY THAT WE MISSED THEM. RECOMMEND STRICTER DRONE POLICIES.,CL300 Captain on approach to SMO reported a NMAC with two UAVs.,2017,10
310,201710,CALIFORNIA,I WAS MID-WAY THROUGH MY 4TH REVOLUTION WHILE TURNING IN A WEAK THERMAL WHEN I HEARD THE DISTINCT TURBINE WHINE OF A LIGHT AIRCRAFT MAGNETO. I LOOKED UP AND BEHIND ME AND OBSERVED A CESSNA 172 OR 152 APPROXIMATELY 100 FT ABOVE MY HANG GLIDER ON GLIDE WITH ITS PROPELLER WIND MILLING. IT APPEARED TO BE ON A 160-DEGREE COURSE HEADING AND PROCEEDED AWAY FROM ME UNINTERRUPTED. BECAUSE I WAS IN DIRECT SUNLIGHT AND THE LARGE HOLOGRAPHIC REFLECTIVE SURFACES ON MY LEADING EDGES WOULD HAVE BEEN EASILY VISIBLE FOR 5 MILES I HAVE TO ASSUME THE PILOT WAS CURIOUS AND GLIDED TOWARD ME INTENTIONALLY. OBVIOUSLY; I DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE PILOT THOUGHT HE WAS SEEING A MYLAR PARTY BALLOON OR KNEW IT WAS A HANG GLIDER BUT IN ANY EVENT THE INCURSION LOOKED INTENTIONAL AND AT 100 FT PROXIMITY WAS UNSAFE.,Hang glider pilot reported a near-mid-air-collision with a general aviation aircraft.,2017,10
311,201710,FLORIDA,AT 12;000 FT CRUISE I ALONG WITH MY COPILOT OBSERVED A DRONE AT SAME LEVEL FLY BY PILOT SIDE WINDOW 100 FT FROM AIRCRAFT. JACKSONVILLE CENTER WAS ADVISED OF SITUATION.,CE560 Captain reported a near miss with a UAV.,2017,10
312,201710,ILLINOIS,WHILE FLYING THE FYTTE4 RNAV STAR TO ORD; WE WERE ON DOWNWIND LEG FOR RWY 27R; LEVEL AT 4000 MSL AND BETWEEN THE VULCN AND HIMGO WAYPOINTS. I AND THE FIRST OFFICER (FO) VISUALLY ACQUIRED A MOSTLY STATIONARY AIRBORNE OBJECT AHEAD OF THE AIRCRAFT AND TO THE RIGHT SIDE OF OUR FLIGHT PATH. WE QUICKLY CLOSED WITH THE OBJECT AND THEN THE OBJECT PASSED OFF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT AT VERY CLOSE RANGE. ALTHOUGH I HAD INITIALLY IDENTIFIED THE OBJECT AS LOOKING LIKE SOME DRIFTING PARTY-TYPE BALLOONS; AS WE PASSED THE OBJECT THE FO STATED 'I THINK IT'S A DRONE'. WHILE I NEVER GOT A GOOD ENOUGH LOOK TO BE CERTAIN THAT THE OBJECT WAS A SMALL UNMANNED DEVICE; THE FO WAS IN A MUCH BETTER POSITION TO VISUALLY TRACK THE OBJECT SO I TRUST HIS JUDGMENT ON THE MATTER. IN ADDITION; I NOTED THAT THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE VERY NEARLY MOTIONLESS; WHICH WOULD BE UNUSUAL FOR BALLOONS; WHICH ARE GENERALLY ASCENDING AT LOW ALTITUDES SUCH AS THIS ONE. AFTER PASSING THE OBJECT; THE FO REPORTED THE PRESENCE OF A POSSIBLE DRONE JUST SOUTH OF OUR COURSE AT PRESENT POSITION. THE ENTIRE EVENT HAPPENED SO QUICKLY THAT AS THE FLYING PILOT I DIDN'T TAKE ANY EVASIVE ACTION; SINCE IT APPEARED THAT WE WOULD MISS THE OBJECT NARROWLY OFF OUR RIGHT-HAND SIDE. THE CAUSE OF THE EVENT WOULD APPEAR TO BE SOMEONE'S RECKLESS DECISION TO INTENTIONALLY OR MISTAKENLY OPERATE A SMALL UNMANNED DEVICE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO AIR TRAFFIC EXECUTING ARRIVAL PROCEDURES TO ORD. EDUCATION OF SMALL UAV OPERATORS IS PARAMOUNT TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS KNOW THAT A SMALL UNMANNED DEVICE CAN POSE A SIGNIFICANT SAFETY HAZARD FOR EVEN SUCH A SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER AIRCRAFT SUCH AS A JET AIRLINER. IN ADDITION; I'M CERTAIN THAT THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS TO DETECT EVEN SMALL UNMANNED DEVICES AND ALERT THE PILOTS OF LARGER AIRCRAFT TO THEIR PRESENCE. THAT TECHNOLOGY WOULD BE HUGELY HELPFUL IN PREVENTING DRONE STRIKES AND NEAR MISSES.,CRJ200 Captain reported a close encounter with a UAV at 4000 feet on the downwind leg for Runway 27R at ORD.,2017,10
313,201710,MINNESOTA,WHILE APPROACHING RUNWAY 32 IN ST. PAUL; MINNESOTA WE HAD BRIEFED THE VISUAL APPROACH TO THE RUNWAY BACKED UP BY ELECTRONIC GUIDANCE; THE ILS. THE WEATHER WAS DAY VFR; AND ONCE WE DESCENDED BELOW THE LOWEST CLOUD LAYER AND HAD VISUALLY SIGHTED THE AIRPORT; WE WERE SETTING UP FOR A RIGHT BASE ENTRY TO LAND RUNWAY 32. WE WERE AT AN ALTITUDE OF 2;500 FEET MSL; 1;800 FEET ABOVE GROUND LEVEL; IN 'CLASS E' AIRSPACE UNDERLYING THE MORE RESTRICTIVE 'CLASS B' AIRSPACE ASSOCIATED WITH THE MAIN AIRPORT IN MINNEAPOLIS. WE WERE APPROXIMATELY FIVE MILES FROM THE AIRPORT AT AN AIRSPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 160 KNOTS; FULLY CONFIGURED FOR LANDING AND THE 'BEFORE LANDING' CHECKLIST COMPLETED; BUT HAD NOT YET INTERCEPTED THE LOCALIZER. I WAS THE FLYING PILOT. I WAS LOOKING INSIDE THE COCKPIT AT THE MULTI FUNCTION DISPLAY SETTING UP TO ALIGN THE AIRCRAFT FOR LANDING; WHEN THE PILOT MONITORING CALLED OUT TO LOOK OUT FOR ANOTHER AIRCRAFT. I LOOKED OUTSIDE IN TIME TO SEE A MAN FLYING A POWERED PARACHUTE AND IMMEDIATELY KICKED OFF THE AUTO PILOT AND ROLLED THE PLANE INTO A SHARP RIGHT BANK TO MISS HIM. WE CAN'T BE FOR SURE HOW CLOSE WE CAME TO HITTING THIS PERSON BUT FEEL WE WERE FORTUNATE TO HAVE MISSED HIM. BOTH OF US COULD SEE HIS FACE AS WE WERE THAT CLOSE. PRIOR TO LANDING AND AFTER LANDING; THE PILOT MONITORING PROVIDED AS MUCH INFORMATION TO THE ST. PAUL TOWER AS WE COULD CONCERNING THE NEAR MISS FOR THEIR RECORD KEEPING AND REPORTING.THIS PERSON WAS APPROXIMATELY 1;800 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND PRESUMABLY DID NOT KNOW THE DIRECTION ST. PAUL'S AIRPORT WAS LANDING. IN OUR OPINION; HE WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT GIVEN THE HEIGHT ABOVE GROUND HE WAS FLYING. ATC HAD NO IDEA HE WAS THERE AS THESE AIRCRAFT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE TRANSPONDERS OR RADIOS. IT WAS PERFECTLY LEGAL FOR HIM TO BE IN 'CLASS E' AIRSPACE WITH NO RADIO OR TRANSPONDER; BUT NOT SAFE. THESE TYPES OF AIRCRAFT DO NOT REQUIRE A PILOT'S LICENSE OR ANY KIND OF AIRSPACE KNOWLEDGE TEST TO LEGALLY OPERATE THEM; AND POSE A SERIOUS CLEAR AND PRESENT DANGER TO OTHER AIRCRAFT; SIMILAR TO THE THREAT DRONES DO IF OPERATED NEAR AIRPORTS. THIS SITUATION REINFORCES OUR SOP'S TO NOT ONLY HAVE A STERILE COCKPIT BELOW 10;000 FEET; BUT ALSO TO HAVE THE PILOT MONITORING TO BE VIGILANT IN LOOKING OUT FOR OTHER AIRCRAFT.,Cessna 750 Captain reported an NMAC during approach with unreported powered parachute operating in close proximity of airport.,2017,10
314,201710,NEW YORK,DURING A FLIGHT TO LGA WHILE WE WERE ON THE LEFT DOWNWIND TO RUNWAY 22 APPROXIMATELY ABEAM LGA AT 4000 FT; THE FO SPOTTED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A FIXED WING DRONE PASS WITHIN 30 FT OF THE AIRCRAFT BY HIS ESTIMATE. THE CREW IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE DRONE TO ATC. ATC SENT THE CREW A NUMBER TO CALL AFTER THE FLIGHT FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS. THE CAPTAIN DID NOT EVER SEE THE DRONE; BUT THE FO SAID HE ONLY JUST SAW IT AS IT FLASHED PAST THE AIRCRAFT.,Air carrier flight crew reported a close encounter with a 'fixed wing drone' at 4000 ft while on left downwind to Runway 22 at LGA.,2017,10
315,201710,NEW YORK,WE WERE HEARING DRONE REPORTS BY ATC. WE WERE EVENTUALLY GIVEN A TRAFFIC ADVISORY FOR THE DRONES OURSELVES. WE KEPT A LOOK OUT AND THE FIRST OFFICER SPOTTED 2 DRONES FLYING ABOUT A HALF MILE LATERALLY TO THE RIGHT OF US; AND 500-1000 FEET BELOW US WHEN WE WERE 2 MILES PRIOR TO GREKO ON THE APPROACH FOR RUNWAY 22 IN LA GUARDIA. HE KEPT THEM IN SIGHT AND WE WERE CLEAR OF THEM; CONTINUING WITHOUT HAVING TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION. THE SUN WAS SETTING AND HE WASN'T SURE IF THE LIGHT WAS REFLECTING OFF OF RED PAINT; OR IF THE DRONES WERE EMITTING A RED LIGHT ON EACH OF THEM. WE REPORTED THE DRONES TO ATC AND MADE A PHONE CALL TO THEM AFTER WE PARKED AT THE GATE.,Air carrier Captain reported sighting 2 UAVs while conducting an approach at LGA. The event was reported to ATC; however no evasive action was taken.,2017,10
316,201710,OHIO,I WAS WORKING LOCAL CONTROL; THE CONTROLLER IN CHARGE (CIC) TOOK A PHONE CALL ON RECORDED LINE. THE PERSON ON THE LINE ASKED IF HE WAS [OUR AIR TRAFFIC MANAGER (ATM)]. THE CIC STATED 'NO'. THE CALLER THEN STATED THAT THE ATM HAD TOLD HIM TO CALL THIS NUMBER PRIOR TO DEPARTING HIS DRONE. THERE WAS ZERO PRIOR COORDINATION WITH THE CONTROLLERS. THE CALLER STATED HE WOULD REMAIN NORTH OF A PARTICULAR ROAD AND BE BELOW 300 FEET. THE CIC ASKED THEM TO NOTIFY US AFTER THEY WERE COMPLETE WITH THEIR OPERATIONS. WE FOUND A BINDER IN THE TOWER; IN THE BACK OF THE CAB; THAT HAS THE DRONE PROCEDURES. WE FOUND THE DRONE PILOTS AUTHORIZATION REQUEST THAT WAS DENIED. HE WAS THEN ISSUED A WAIVER THAT STATED HE WAS TO REMAIN BELOW 75 FEET. BASED ON OUR GRID AND HOW CLOSE TO OUR AIRPORT THIS WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE; HE SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN GRANTED APPROVAL IN THE FIRST PLACE.THERE WAS ALSO AN EMAIL BETWEEN THE PILOT AND THE ATM WHERE THE PILOT STATED HE WOULD BE CLIMBING TO AT LEAST 100 FEET AND UP TO 300 FEET ON ONE. THIS IS COMPLETELY AGAINST THE WAIVER THE PILOT RECEIVED. THE ATM WOULD'VE KNOWN ABOUT THIS. THE FLIGHT PATH OF THE DRONE PUT THEM IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH DEPARTURES AND WAS ESPECIALLY A CONFLICT FOR TWO AIRCRAFT I HAD DOING PATTERN TRAFFIC. THIS WAS VERY UNSAFE. IT WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE TO KNOW ABOUT A DRONE THAT'S IN DIRECT CONFLICT WITH AIRCRAFT IN MY AIRSPACE. THERE SHOULD HAVE BEEN NOTIFICATION THAT THIS WAS GOING TO TAKE PLACE. THERE SHOULD ALSO HAVE BEEN SOMEONE INSTRUCTING THE DRONE PILOT TO ADHERE TO HIS 75 FOOT RESTRICTION.,DAY Controller reported a drone pilot operated a drone in violation of their Authorization Request.,2017,10
317,201710,OREGON,I WAS WORKING [A B737] ON THE STAR. I HAD TO TAKE HIM OFF THE ARRIVAL FOR AN UNIDENTIFIED VFR PRIMARY TARGET FLYING THROUGH THE APPROACH CORRIDOR. [THE B737] WAS TOLD OF THE TRAFFIC AND DIDN'T SEE IT; SO I BASED [THE B737] TO MISS THE PRIMARY TARGET AND THE PRIMARY TARGET DECIDED TO TURN TOWARDS [THE B737]. [THE B737] WAS BASED HIGH AND CLOSE TO BREAKING THE NOISE RESTRICTION. [THE B737] EVENTUALLY SAW THE TRAFFIC AND IT WAS NO FACTOR.THIS IS A DAILY PROBLEM AND SOMEONE IS GOING TO EVENTUALLY GET HURT. THERE NEEDS TO BE AN AIRSPACE DESIGN CHANGE. VFR TARGETS CONSTANTLY FLY THROUGH THE APPROACH CORRIDOR AT BAD ALTITUDES THAT CONFLICT WITH AIRCRAFT ON FINAL OR TURNING BASE. OFTEN THEY ARE PRIMARY TARGETS WITH NO TRANSPONDERS AND HIGH ENOUGH TO BE A MAJOR CONCERN. THIS SITUATION IS VERY BAD AND NOTHING SEEMS TO BE HAPPENING ABOUT IT.,P80 TRACON Controller cancelled an arrival's STAR and vectored the aircraft to avoid an unidentified VFR aircraft flying through the final approach course.,2017,10
318,201710,PENNSYLVANIA,DURING CLIMB OUT FROM PHILADELPHIA INTERNATIONAL THE AIRCRAFT WAS CLIMBING TO MAINTAIN THE INITIAL ALTITUDE WHEN I DETECTED AN OBJECT IN MY LEFT PERIPHERAL VISION. WE WERE LOCATED JUST EAST OF THE DOWNTOWN AREA OF PHILADELPHIA CLIMBING THROUGH 4;500 FEET. I TURNED MY HEAD AND SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A FOUR BLADED UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE JUST WEST OF OUR PATH AND SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET BELOW THE AIRCRAFT BY THE TIME WE PASSED ABEAM THE OBJECT. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS REQUIRED NOR TAKEN.THE CONTROLLER WAS BUSY COMMUNICATING TO ANOTHER AIRCRAFT AND SOON AS THE FREQUENCY CLEARED I REPORTED SEEING A 'DRONE' JUST TO THE WEST OF US NEAR THE DOWNTOWN AREA. WE WERE GIVEN A NEW FREQUENCY TO CHECK IN WITH NEW YORK CENTER. UPON CHECKING IN WITH NEW YORK I WAS TOLD TO CONTACT PHILADELPHIA APPROACH WITH A PHONE NUMBERAFTER COMPLETING MY FLIGHT I CONTACTED TO THE NUMBER. I WAS ASKED WHAT TYPE OF VEHICLE IT WAS. WHAT COLOR I THOUGHT IT WAS; BROWN OR GOLD COLOR. WHAT WEIGHT DID I THINK IT WAS; I THOUGHT IT WAS LARGE BUT COULD NOT SAY IF IT WAS 50 POUNDS OR MORE AND ESTIMATED IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN 500 FEET BELOW US. ALL THESE VARIABLES WERE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE SINCE WE WERE CLIMBING BUT I DID APPEARED TO LARGE AND DID NOT APPEAR TO MOVE.,CRJ-200 Captain reported observing a UAV during climbout from PHL.,2017,10
319,201711,COLORADO,AIRCRAFT X WAS IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN FOR RUNWAY 30L; WAS EXTENDED UPWIND AND TOLD TOWER WOULD CALL CROSSWIND TURN TO ACCOMMODATE AIRCRAFT Z [A VINTAGE WARBIRD] PERFORMING THE OVERHEAD MANEUVER ON SAME RUNWAY BEHIND THEM. AIRCRAFT Y WAS FOLLOWING AIRCRAFT X AND WAS TOLD TO EXTEND UPWIND TO FOLLOW THAT TRAFFIC. AIRCRAFT X WAS OBSERVED APPROXIMATE 3NM SOUTHWEST OF THE FIELD AND QUESTIONED WHETHER THEY WERE STAYING IN PATTERN OR DEPARTING AREA. AIRCRAFT X RESPONDED THAT THEY WERE ON THE CROSSWIND AWAITING FOR ME TO INSTRUCT DOWNWIND TURN. I THEN INSTRUCTED THEM TO MAKE A RIGHT 180 DEGREE TURN TO REJOIN LEFT DOWNWIND AND ISSUED TRAFFIC TO FOLLOW THAT WOULD BE JUST SOUTH OF THE VOR. AIRCRAFT X REPEATED INSTRUCTIONS. AIRCRAFT Y WAS SEQUENCED NUMBER ONE FOR RUNWAY 30L AND ISSUED TOUCH AND GO CLEARANCE.AIRCRAFT X WAS OBSERVED VIA RADAR CLOSE TO DOWNWIND; WAS TOLD TO ENTER DOWNWIND AND ISSUED NUMBER 2 SEQUENCE BEHIND THE TRAFFIC DOWNWIND TO BASE AND CLEARED RUNWAY 30L TOUCH AND GO. AIRCRAFT X REPEATED ALL INSTRUCTIONS; INCLUDING CLEARANCE TO RUNWAY30L. OTHER CALLS WERE MADE WHEN I NOTICED AIRCRAFT Y STOPPED MIDFIELD ON THE RUNWAY; I RECOGNIZED THAT AIRCRAFT X MAY HAVE TO GO AROUND AND BEGAN A VISUAL SCAN TO LOCATE THEM; THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON FINAL AT THIS TIME. I COULD NOT LOCATE THEM ON FINAL AND AT THAT TIME; AIRCRAFT X REPORTED 'GOING AROUND'. I SCANNED FROM THE APPROACH END OF RUNWAY 30L THEN TOWARDS THE DEPARTURE END AND I SAW AIRCRAFT X OPPOSITE DIRECTION APPROXIMATELY 100 FT AGL OVER THE AIRCRAFT Y ON THE RUNWAY. AIRCRAFT Y WAS STOPPED; NOT BECAUSE OF AN ISSUE WITH THEIR AIRCRAFT; BUT THEY SAW THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC APPROACHING AND THEY PULLED OFF TO THE SIDE TO TRY TO ACCOMMODATE. AIRCRAFT X WAS ISSUED FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS TO SEQUENCE FOR THE APPROPRIATE RUNWAY. NO FURTHER ISSUES CAME FROM THIS EVENT. WHEN QUESTIONED AIRCRAFT X SAID THERE WAS A LOT OF 'RADIO CHATTER' AND HE GOT CONFUSED; THERE WAS NO INSTRUCTOR ON BOARD AT THE TIME.RECOMMENDATION: MAINTAIN AWARENESS OF ALL AREAS; WHEN A PILOT IS NOT DOING WHAT THEY WERE INSTRUCTED TO BEGIN WITH THEY SHOULD REQUIRE MORE ATTENTION. KEEP A GOOD SCAN AND WHEN YOU NOTICE SOMETHING IS NOT LOOKING/FEELING RIGHT SOLICIT HELP FROM OTHER TOWER TEAM MEMBERS.,BJC Tower Controller reported that after issuing instructions to an aircraft on pattern traffic and receiving the correct read-back instructions; the pilot aligned on final to the opposite runway.,2017,11
320,201711,MASSACHUSETTS,DURING CLIMB OUT; I WAS ABOUT 2700 FEET; 6-8 MILES SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF BOSTON; I BELIEVE OVER THE QUINCY/BRAINTREE AREA; I CAME WITHIN A COUPLE HUNDRED FEET OF DRONE. IT WAS ABOUT 2 FEET BY 2 FEET IN SIZE; BLACK; FOUR BLADE; AND WAS ROCKING BACK AND FORTH IN THE TURBULENCE. I REPORTED IT TO BOSTON DEPARTURE. THE NEXT CONTROLLER FOLLOWED UP WITH MORE QUESTIONS ABOUT IT. AFTER ARRIVING AT MY DESTINATION; I WAS TOLD TO CONTACT THE MASSACHUSETTS STATE POLICE. I CALLED AND JUST VERIFIED WHAT I TOLD ATC.,A Small Transport Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV operating in Boston Class B airspace without ATC knowledge. Pilot reported incident to A90 Departure; and Massachusetts State police.,2017,11
321,201711,NEVADA,MADE STREET LANDING IN RESIDENTIAL WEST SIDE AREA. COMPLAINT FROM HOME OWNER BECAUSE HE BELIEVES I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT I WAS DOING; EVEN THOUGH I HAVE OVER 40 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE. I SAID NOTHING TO THE HOME OWNER BECAUSE THAT WOULD HAVE MADE HIS RAGE WORSE. WE PACKED THE BALLOON IN 5 MINUTES AND PROMISED WE WOULD NEVER RETURN. WEATHER WAS TOO CALM WHICH PREVENTED US FROM GOING FARTHER TO OPEN DIRT AREA. THIS RESIDENT MUST HAVE HAD A BAD NIGHT AT THE CASINO.,A balloon pilot reported having to land on a residential street due to inability to safely continue to an open area.,2017,11
322,201711,NORTH CAROLINA,COMING THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 3;000 FT ON THE VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 23 IN CLT I NOTICED A DRONE PASS BY MY WINDOW AND OFF THE WINGTIP OF THE AIRCRAFT BY ABOUT 5 TO 10 FEET. IT WAS DUSK AND I COULD NOT TELL WHAT TYPE OR THE CONFIGURATION OF THE DRONE BUT IT DID HAVE A NAVIGATION LIGHT ON IT AND SOME TYPE OF STROBE/ANTI-COLLISION LIGHT. I NOTIFIED ATC IMMEDIATELY AND AFTER REACHING THE GATE I CONTACTED CLT APPROACH VIA PHONE AS INSTRUCTED. I WAS TOLD THAT THREE AIRCRAFT BEHIND US ALSO REPORTED SEEING THE DRONE AND THAT THEY HAD SHUT DOWN RUNWAY 23 APPROACHES AND GONE TO A PARALLEL SOUTH OPERATION. THEY ALSO ADVISED THAT THE [THE LOCAL] POLICE HELICOPTER HAD BEEN DISPATCHED AND WAS ABLE TO FIND AN APPROXIMATE LOCATION. DRONES SHOULD HAVE FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS PROGRAMMED INTO THEIR SOFTWARE.,CRJ-900 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV on approach to CLT.,2017,11
323,201711,OHIO,DURING DESCENT FOR LANDING AT I19; AT APPROXIMATELY 2500 FT MSL OVER POPULATED AREA; I OBSERVED A SMALL BLACK DOT AT MY SAME ALTITUDE; AND 1 O'CLOCK FROM MY POSITION. I BANKED SLIGHT LEFT TO AVOID THE OBJECT. AS I PASSED THE OBJECT; I OBSERVED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A STATIONARY DRONE OF THE HOBBY STORE VARIETY. I FELT THIS TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS ACTIVITY ON THE PART OF THE DRONE OPERATOR THAT COULD EASILY HAVE ENDED IN LOSS OF LIFE OR SEVERE DAMAGE TO THE AIRCRAFT IF I HAD NOT SEEN IT IN TIME TO MANEUVER AWAY.,PA28 pilot reported a NMAC with a UAV on approach to I19.,2017,11
324,201711,TEXAS,DEPARTED GPM AT 2500 WITH A SOUTHERLY HEADING UNTIL CLEAR OF CEDAR HILL (ALL THE BIG TOWERS). ONCE CLEAR; I STARTED TO TURN LEFT TO OVERFLY JWY AND CLIMB TO 3000. AFTER CLASS B; I STARTED MY CLIMB TO 7500 TOWARD THE LITTLE ROCK AREA. I WAS USING TERRELL (TRL) AS A FIX AND A CHECK FOR WEATHER (ALTIMETER) WHEN I NOTICED SOMETHING THAT LOOKED LIKE A BIRD. SINCE I FLY A LOT IN THE SGT AREA; I SEE A LOT OF BIRDS OF DIFFERENT TYPES - AND I THOUGHT I WAS SEEING A BIRD AT FIRST. I THOUGHT - GOOD; I'M HIGHER AND THE BIRD SHOULD NOT BE A FACTOR. THEN I TRIED TO RE-FOCUS MY EYES AS THE MOVEMENT WASN'T QUITE LIKE A BIRD - CLOSE; BUT NOT THE SAME. WORSE; MY BRAIN WAS NOT MAKING SENSE OF WHAT KIND OF BIRD THIS MIGHT BE AS I WAS TRYING TO 'SEE' A BLACK VULTURE. WHAT MY EYES KEPT TELLING ME IS THIS BLACK VULTURE HAD FOUR EVENLY SPACE RED DOTS (AS A SQUARE) ON ITS BACK!THEN I GOT MAD - THAT'S A DRONE. AND SINCE I DON'T KNOW A LOT ABOUT THEM; I HAVE NO WAY TO PROCESS HOW CLOSE THE DRONE WAS. MY BEST GUESS IS WITHIN 500 FT.MY POSITION: ABOUT 6 MILES SOUTHWEST OF TRL AT 7500 FLYING A MAGNETIC HEADING OF 065.,BE35 pilot reported a NMAC with a UAV at 7500 ft in the vicinity of TRL airport.,2017,11
325,201711,UTAH,DURING A NIGHT; VISUAL APPROACH; ATC ADVISED US OF A RADAR RETURN AT OUR '2 O'CLOCK'. THEY SAID IT COULD POSSIBLY BE BIRDS. I; BEING PILOT MONITORING; BEGAN TO VISUALLY SCAN BECAUSE THE PILOT WAS FOCUSING ON OUR SOON TO BE LANDING. I SPOTTED A STATIONARY RED BEACON ABEAM OUR WING AND ABOUT 1-2 MILES AT OUR ALTITUDE (5;000 FT). I ULTIMATELY DECIDED IT WAS EITHER A DRONE OR A HELICOPTER MUCH FURTHER AWAY. I ASKED TOWER IF THERE WAS A HELICOPTER TO THE EAST AND THEY SAID NEGATIVE. I TOLD THEM THE POSITION OF THE DRONE AND THEY CONFIRMED THAT'S WHERE THE RETURN WAS COMING FROM. AS FOR US AND OUR FLIGHT PATH THE DRONE WAS NOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE A THREAT; BUT IF WE WERE APPROACHED RUNWAY 35 OR EVEN 32 IT WOULD HAVE BEEN MUCH CLOSER.THE ONLY THING I COULD THINK OF IS TO GET A MORE PRECISE DESCRIPTION OF THE POSITION OF THE DRONE. IT WAS DIFFICULT PREPARING FOR LANDING AND TENDING TO THIS SITUATION SIMULTANEOUSLY.,An air taxi turboprop Captain reported being advised by air traffic control of possible birds in the vicinity of his aircraft. It appeared the target was actually a drone operating nearby; however it did not appear to be a threat; and no evasive action was required.,2017,11
326,201712,CALIFORNIA,DURING DESCENT ON THE STAR AND CLEARED FOR THE ILS APPROACH; AT APPROXIMATELY 9300 FEET; THE FIRST OFFICER SAW A WHITE DRONE PASS UNDER OUR RIGHT WING AT APPROXIMATELY 9100 FEET.,A B737 Captain reported a near miss with a drone.,2017,12
327,201712,CALIFORNIA,DEPARTING LAX; DOTSS 2 DEPARTURE ASSIGNED 5000 FT. WE WERE GIVE SEVERAL TURNS AND THEN DIRECT PEVEE CLIMBING TO 9000 FT THEN 12000 FT THEN ISSUED 'CLIMB VIA SID' THEN FL230. WHILE IN THE TURN TO PEVEE THE PRECEDING AIRCRAFT REPORTED SIGHTING A DRONE AT 13000 FT. WE WANTED TO CLARIFY THE CLIMB VIA INSTRUCTION AND GET A VECTOR LEFT TO AVOID THE AREA OF THE DRONE SIGHTING. ONCE THE CAPTAIN WAS ABLE TO FINALLY ASK FOR CLARIFICATION THE CONTROLLER ISSUED A CLIMB TO FL230 AND STATED 'YOU'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE THAT CLIMB RESTRICTION HERE'S THE NUMBER TO CALL FOR A PILOT DEVIATION.' WE WERE STILL AT 12000 FT AND APPROXIMATELY 17 NM FROM THE 15000 FT OR ABOVE RESTRICTION AT DOTSS WHEN HE MADE THAT PRONOUNCEMENT. WE ENDED UP CROSSING DOTSS AT APPROXIMATELY 17000 FT.AFTER SPEAKING WITH A SUPERVISOR AT THE SOCAL ATC FACULTY; IT SEEMS THE CONTROLLER WAS A BIT TASK SATURATED WITH THE DRONE IN THE AREA AND COORDINATING WITH OTHER AIRCRAFT. HE ALSO STATED THERE WAS NO VIOLATION.,A321 flight crew reported being distracted by reports of a drone on departure from LAX.,2017,12
328,201712,CALIFORNIA,I WAS PM (PILOT MONITORING). CAPTAIN WAS PF (PILOT FLYING). WE HAVE FLOWN MANY TIMES TOGETHER. WE DEPARTED ON THE OAK 2 DEPARTURE. WE WERE DELAYED AT THE GATE BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT MANIFESTED ITSELF AS A CAUSAL FACTOR IN THE BIRD STRIKE. WE LEVELED OFF AT 2000 FT AS WE CHECKED IN WITH NORCAL DEPARTURE. NORCAL TOLD US THAT ONE MILE IN FRONT OF US THERE MIGHT BE TRAFFIC. THE CONTROLLER WAS GETTING A NON-REPORTING RETURN. WE DID NOT ACQUIRE ANY TRAFFIC. CONTROLLER REPORTED US CLEAR AND INSTRUCTED US TO CLIMB UNRESTRICTED TO FL190. WE PUT 19;000 FT IN THE ALTITUDE AND INITIATED A CLIMB. JUST AS THE CLIMB STARTED; WE PASSED THROUGH A FLOCK OF BIRDS THAT WERE NOT DISCERNIBLE UNTIL THEY WERE RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. THEY WERE BROWN IN COLOR AND; FOR THE MOMENT I SAW THEM; APPEARED SMALLER THAN WATER FOWL; MAYBE FINCH TO CROW SIZE. WE KNEW WE HAD AT LEAST ONE STRIKE; AUDIBLE. WE SUSPECTED MORE.AIRCRAFT PERFORMED NORMALLY ON CONTROLS. ENGINE INDICATIONS REMAINED ENTIRELY NORMAL. NO ABNORMAL ODOR. CAPTAIN REMAINED PF. I RELAYED TO ATC THE BIRD STRIKE. I THEN REFERRED TO THE QRH (NO GUIDANCE); AOM (AIRCRAFT OPERATING MANUAL) NON NORMAL BIRD STRIKES; AND [OTHER MANUALS] GUIDANCE. WE CONTACTED DISPATCH WITH NOTIFICATION OF THE STRIKE. ABOUT THIS TIME; NON-REV PILOT IN BACK COMMUNICATED THAT THERE WAS A LARGE DENT IN THE NUMBER 2 NACELLE LEADING EDGE. CAPTAIN KEPT CONTROL. USING SECURITY PROTOCOL; I WENT TO PASSENGER COMPARTMENT AND OBSERVED DAMAGE. BASEBALL-SOFTBALL SIZED DENT LEADING EDGE NUMBER 2 NACELLE. THE DENT CONTOUR SUGGESTED THAT THE BIRD REMAINS WENT OVER NACELLE NOT THRU THE ENGINE. WE TOOK PHOTOS. WE REVIEWED PHOTOS ON FLIGHT DECK AND; GIVEN GOOD ENGINE OPS AND NO OTHER OBSERVED DAMAGE WE ELECTED TO CONTINUE.SAFE; UNEVENTFUL FLIGHT; APPROACH; AND LANDING. UPON POST FLIGHT INSPECTION; WE OBSERVED A SOFTBALL SIZE HOLE IN THE LEADING EDGE OF THE FO (FIRST OFFICER) SIDE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER. THIS WAS A LOCATION OF ANOTHER STRIKE. WE COULD NOT OBSERVE THIS LOCATION IN FLIGHT AND; SINCE THE AIRCRAFT WAS OPERATING ENTIRELY NORMALLY; WE HAD NO REASON TO SUSPECT SIGNIFICANT FURTHER DAMAGE ON AIRCRAFT.,Air Carrier flight crew reported a bird strike during departure.,2017,12
329,201712,FLORIDA,WHILE CLIMBING OUT; I SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SMALL (LESS THAN 5 FT IN SIZE; MAY HAVE BEEN ROUND) UNLIT UNKNOWN AIRBORNE OBJECT IN FLIGHT PATH FROM THE CORNER OF MY EYE AT THE LAST SECOND. UNFORTUNATELY; I AM UNABLE TO DESCRIBE THE OBJECT BETTER. WHILE AVOIDING THE OBJECT; MY AIRCRAFT MAY HAVE INADVERTENTLY CLIMBED INTO CLASS C AIRSPACE PRIOR TO ESTABLISHING 2 WAY RADIO COMMUNICATION.,Super Decathlon pilot reported inadvertently climbing into Class C airspace while avoiding what was probably a UAV in the vicinity of OMN airport.,2017,12
330,201712,FLORIDA,UPON REACHING THE HOLD SHORT LINE RUNWAY 9 KEY WEST THE CAPTAIN NOTED THAT THE SELECTED AIRSPEED READOUT SHOWED AMBER DASHES. I SAID THAT I THOUGHT IT WAS BECAUSE SOMETHING WAS MISSING IN THE FMS. THE CAPTAIN SAID THAT WE COULD JUST USE MANUAL SPEEDS AND FLIPPED THE SPEED SELECTOR SWITCH TO MANUAL. I ASKED HIM IF HE WANTED TO TAKE A MINUTE AND FIGURE IT OUT. HE SAID IT WAS FINE (ALL PARAPHRASED; I DON'T REMEMBER THE EXACT WORDS). AT SOME POINT WE RECEIVED THE TAKEOFF CLEARANCE. WE WERE ASSIGNED RUNWAY HEADING. I DON'T REMEMBER IF I CALLED OR THE TOWER GAVE IT UNSOLICITED. AT THIS POINT I WAS STILL TRYING TO PROCESS THE AMBER DASHES ISSUE. THE CAPTAIN CALLED FOR THE BEFORE TAKEOFF CHECKLIST; AND WE GOT 'TAKEOFF OKAY.'ON THE ROLL I MISSED THE 80 KNOT CALLOUT (THAT NEVER HAPPENS). I WAS STILL DISTRACTED. AROUND 90-95 KNOTS THE CAPTAIN ASKED; 80 KNOTS? WITH THE FLAPS 4 TAKEOFF V1 WAS RAPIDLY APPROACHING AND I MADE THE V1 CALL. ROTATE. I MISSED THE 'POSITIVE RATE' CALL. THAT ALSO NEVER HAPPENS. AT 400 FT HE CALLED FOR HEADING AND I SELECTED HDG. WE GOT HANDED OFF TO MIAMI CENTER. I FLIPPED THE FREQUENCY; BUT DID NOT CALL. I USUALLY WAIT FOR FLAP RETRACTION SO I'M NOT ON THE RADIO WHILE THE CAPTAIN IS ASKING FOR FLAP RETRACTION. AT 1000 FT HE ASKED FOR VNAV AND I SELECTED VNAV; BUT WE DIDN'T GET IT. THE TAKEOFF CROSSBAR REMAINED; AND A MESSAGE APPEARED ON THE FMS. SOMETHING LIKE 'VERTICAL MODE NOT AVAILABLE' OR 'VERTICAL GUIDANCE UNAVAILABLE.' WE WENT THROUGH THE FLAP RETRACTIONS IN THE CLIMB WHILE THE CAPTAIN WAS MANUALLY SELECTING SPEEDS. ALSO AT SOME POINT THE AUTO THROTTLES WERE DISCONNECTED. I'M NOT SURE IF IT WAS THE CAPTAIN OR A RESULT OF THE VNAV/AMBER DASHES ISSUE. MY CALL TO MIAMI WAS DELAYED BECAUSE OF THE DISTRACTION OF THE VNAV ISSUE AND THE EXTRA STEPS IN RETRACTING FLAPS FROM 4 INSTEAD OF 2. WE ATE UP MILES ON RUNWAY HEADING. MIAMI GAVE US 'DIRECT CURSO.' IT TOOK ME THREE TRIES TO SET UP THE SIMPLE TASK OF DIRECT TO CURSO. WE HAD NOW CONTINUED FURTHER ON RUNWAY HEADING. WE SELECTED THE DIRECT TO AND TURNED TOWARD CURSO. SHORTLY AFTER THE TURN; AT BETWEEN 4000 AND 4500 WE GOT GND PROX WITH AN AURAL 'TERRAIN TERRAIN' AND THE TERRAIN AWARENESS DISPLAY SHOWED A RED CIRCLE JUST INSIDE MY 5 NM RING ON THE MFD. THE MAGENTA LINE WENT RIGHT THROUGH IT. I IMMEDIATELY KNEW IT WAS THE TETHERED RADAR BALLOON. I TOLD THE CAPTAIN IT'S THE BALLOON. HE SAID THAT IT WAS OKAY; THAT WE WERE CLIMBING. I SAID NO; WERE NOT GOING TO OUT CLIMB THAT! I RECEIVED NO RESPONSE; SO I TOOK THE YOKE; DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPILOT AND TURNED THE AIRPLANE TO THE LEFT. I THINK WE STAYED OUT OF THE RESTRICTED AIRSPACE; BUT I CANNOT CONFIRM THAT.AFTER CLEARING THE BALLOON MIAMI GAVE US A 040 VECTOR TO CURSO. WE RESUMED DIRECT TO CURSO. WHEN I ACCESSED THE PERF DATA PAGE TO BEGIN THE PROCESS OF GETTING THE LANDING SPEEDS THERE WAS NO DATA. I BELIEVE IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT THE CAPTAIN RE-ENTERED THE ZERO FUEL WEIGHT; AND THE PERF DATA PAGE POPULATED THE DATA I WAS LOOKING FOR. THE CAPTAIN STATED THAT HE BELIEVED THE ZERO FUEL WEIGHT WAS THE SOURCE OF THE ORIGINAL PROBLEM WITH THE AIRSPEED READOUT AND THE VERTICAL MODE. I WAS ABLE TO GET THE LANDING SPEEDS AND WE CONTINUED THE FLIGHT WITHOUT INCIDENT. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE AS FOS TRUST OUR INSTINCTS. WHILE WE HAVE MUCH LESS EXPERIENCE ON THE PLANE THAN THE CAPTAIN; WE ARE STILL FULLY QUALIFIED ON THE EQUIPMENT. SLOW DOWN PROCEDURES. THERE WAS A VERY FAST PACE IN THE COCKPIT PRIOR TO CLOSING THE DOOR. IT WAS AN ATMOSPHERE OF EVERYTHING NEEDS TO BE HAPPENING FAST. AS WE CLOSED 11 MINUTES EARLY; I EVEN ASKED THE QUESTION; 'WHY IS EVERYONE IN SUCH A HURRY? WE'RE EARLY.' I GOT NO RESPONSE. FIRST RED FLAG.,Air carrier First Officer reported they may have entered Restricted Airspace without clearance. A CRM breakdown contributed to the event.,2017,12
331,201712,MINNESOTA,A SMALL UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS OPERATOR WAS FLYING A MULTI ROTOR COPTER AT NIGHT OVER NON-PARTICIPATING PEOPLE AT [A PARK] IN ST. PAUL. THE OPERATOR DID NOT MAINTAIN SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND LINE OF SIGHT AT ALL TIMES AS THE AIR VEHICLE PASSED BEHIND TREES. THE WATERFOWL IN THE AREA WERE DISTURBED BY THE PRESENCE OF THE SUAS AND MOVED AWAY FROM THE SUAS. COMO LAKE SERVES AS A VISUAL REPORTING POINT FOR APPROACH TO ST. PAUL DOWNTOWN AIRPORT. THE OPERATOR WAS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE LAKE ON A PENINSULA JUTTING OUT INTO THE LAKE JUST INSIDE THE CLASS D AIRSPACE FOR ST. PAUL DOWNTOWN AIRPORT. THE SUAS WAS EQUIPPED WITH NONSTANDARD AIRCRAFT LIGHTING. A PERSON WITH ME STATED THEY SAW A SECOND SUAS WITHOUT ANY AIRCRAFT LIGHTING. I WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE SECOND ONE. THE LIGHTED AIRCRAFT STAYED OVER NONPARTICIPATING PEOPLE FOR ABOUT A MINUTE.,A ground observer reported a UAV was operated at night over a group of people in a public park.,2017,12
332,201712,NEVADA,THE PROBLEM WAS A NEAR MID AIR COLLISION WITH SMALL DRONE AT 6500 MSL THAT APPEARED TO BE MOVING SOUTHERLY WHILE MY AIRPLANE WAS FLYING A MAGNETIC HEADING OF 200 APPROXIMATELY. OUR LATERAL SEPARATION WAS BETWEEN 150-200 FEET. WE WERE IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF LAS; ALMOST DIRECTLY ABOVE THE APPROACH END OF RUNWAY 26L. THE DRONE WAS YELLOW IN COLOR AND CIRCULAR; AT MOST 3 FEET IN DIAMETER; AND DID NOT APPEAR FIXED WING. IT APPEARED TO HAVE SOME KIND OF DESIGN/CAMERA AT ITS CENTER. WE WERE RECEIVING RADAR VECTORS FROM LAS VEGAS TRACON. I WAS SCANNING VISUALLY WHILE MY STUDENT WAS UNDER THE VIEW LIMITING DEVICE. WE MADE NO EVASIVE ACTION; THERE WAS MERELY A SECOND BETWEEN THE TIME I SAW THE DRONE AND IT'S PASSING OF OUR POSITION. I QUERIED LAS VEGAS APPROACH IF THERE WAS ANY DRONE ACTIVITY IN THE AREA; THEY RESPONDED THERE WAS NOT; I THEN PROCEEDED TO DESCRIBE THE SITUATION; TO WHICH THEY ASKED QUESTIONS REGARDING THE DRONE'S ALTITUDE AND FLIGHT PATH; AND PRIOR TO OUR HAND OFF THEY SAID THEY HAD MADE A REPORT. THIS NEAR MID AIR COLLISION WAS NO FAULT OF LAS VEGAS APPROACH OR MY OWN; RATHER THE DRONE OPERATOR WHO VIOLATED THE AIRSPACE.,C172 flight instructor reported a NMAC with a UAV at 6500 in the vicinity of LAS airport.,2017,12
333,201712,OREGON,I WAS WORKING FINAL ON A RUNWAY 10 FLOW INTO PORTLAND. A REGIONAL JET WAS DESCENDING VIA THE TIMBERS ARRIVAL STAR AND LEVEL AT 5000. I NOTICED A VFR TARGET SQUAWKING 1200 EASTBOUND AT 4700. THE AIRCRAFT PRECEDED TO CROSS THE TIMBERS STAR. I ISSUED TRAFFIC TO THE CRJ AND THE AIRCRAFT NEVER GOT THE 1200 TARGET IN SIGHT. I HAD TO TURN AND ISSUE AN EXPEDITED DESCENT TO THE CRJ TO AVOID MERGING THE TARGETS. THE UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT CONTINUED EASTBOUND; JUST SOUTH OF KPDX AND I HANDED THE TARGET OFF TO THE HOOD SECTOR. HOOD STOPPED ALL PDX DEPARTURES AT 4000 AS THE TARGET CONTINUED TO FLY UP THE DEPARTURE CORRIDOR AT A SLOW RATE OF SPEED. THIS WAS NOT A SAFE OPERATION. IN NO WAY WHATSOEVER. OUR CLASS CHARLIE AIRSPACE IS COMPLETELY AT FAULT. THE AIRCRAFT TECHNICALLY DIDN'T DEVIATE PROTECTED AIRSPACE. HOWEVER; OUR ARRIVAL ROUTES ARE NOT PROTECTED BY THE CLASS CHARLIE RULES. THE TIMBERS ARRIVAL DESCENDS TO 5000 FEET AND OFTEN WE CAN'T GO LOWER BECAUSE OF TERRAIN AND ARRIVALS/DEPARTURES OFF OF KHIO AIRPORT. THE FINAL SECTOR'S AIRSPACE NEEDS TO BE PROTECTED AT THE STANDARD DOWNWIND/BASE/FINAL APPROACH ALTITUDES.EVERY DAY THERE ARE TARGETS CROSSING FINAL IN FRONT OF AIRCRAFT; BELOW AIRCRAFT; AND ABOVE AIRCRAFT AND WE AREN'T TALKING TO THOSE AIRPLANES AND HAVE NO WAY TO VERIFY THEIR MODE C. IT IS EXTREMELY UNSAFE; AND UNFORTUNATELY; SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN SOMEDAY THAT WE ALL ARE DESPERATELY TRYING TO AVOID. THIS NEEDS TO BE FIXED SOON; LIKE YESTERDAY.,P80 TRACON Controller reported the PDX class C airspace compromises separation for arrivals and departures due to non-participating air traffic in the area.,2017,12
334,201712,OREGON,I WAS WORKING THE FINAL SECTOR ON A RUNWAY 10 FLOW INTO PORTLAND. I NOTICED TWO PRIMARY TARGETS NORTH OF MY AIRSPACE HEADING SOUTHBOUND. I DID A MINIMUM SEPARATION FUNCTION ON THE STARS DISPLAY AND DECIDED THAT THE TARGETS WERE LIKELY GOING TO BE CLOSE TO MY B737 JET. BUT THE TARGETS WERE SPACED OUT IN SUCH A WAY THAT I COULDN'T EXTEND THE B737 ON THE DOWNWIND TO MISS THE FIRST TARGET; BECAUSE IT WOULD LIKELY MERGE WITH THE SECOND TARGET. I DESCENDED THE B737 JET AND TURNED BASE; HOPING TO TURN FINAL SOUTH OF THE TWO TARGETS. I CALLED TRAFFIC AT LEAST 3 OR 4 TIMES TO THE B737 JET AND THE PILOT NEVER GOT EITHER TARGET IN SIGHT. I THEN CALLED LOCAL 2 AND ASKED IF THEY COULD SEE ANY LOW LEVEL AIRCRAFT OUT TO THE WEST. THEY SAID NO. THE TARGET EVENTUALLY GOT TO WITHIN .333 OF A MILE TO THE B737 AT ABOUT A 6 MILE FINAL BEFORE IT CROSSED FINAL AND HEADED TO THE SOUTHEAST. THE SECOND TARGET DID NOT CROSS FINAL AND INSTEAD APPEARED TO LAND AT [ A SATELLITE] AIRPORT.THIS WAS A NORMAL/DAILY OPERATION AT KPDX. UNIDENTIFIED TARGETS; BOTH PRIMARY TARGETS AND 1200 CODES; CROSS PORTLAND FINAL ALL DAY CONSTANTLY AND THEY HARDLY EVER CALL APPROACH FOR FLIGHT FOLLOWING. ONE DAY THIS IS GOING TO END IN A NEAR MIDAIR OR EVEN WORSE. THERE ARE A LOT OF CONTROLLERS HERE [SUBMITTING SAFETY REPORTS ON] THESE EVENTS AND WE GET LITTLE TO NO FEEDBACK. MANAGEMENT SEEMS INDIFFERENT AS WELL. WHAT DO YOU WANT US TO DO? ONE DAY A COLLISION IS GOING TO BE UNAVOIDABLE WITHOUT AN AIRSPACE DESIGN CHANGE. IT REALLY IS.,P80 TRACON Controller reported the PDX class C airspace does not provide separation to arrivals from non-participating air traffic.,2017,12
335,201712,WISCONSIN,I SPOTTED A DRONE WHICH APPEARED TO BE A QUADCOPTER GO RIGHT UNDERNEATH US ON THE LOCALIZER. IT APPEARED TO GO UNDERNEATH US A HUNDRED FEET OR SO GOING THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. I WAS RIGHT OFF THE COAST OVER LAKE MICHIGAN OFF THE 25L LOCALIZER MKE.ALWAYS KEEP AN EYE OUT AT LOW ALTITUDE.,CE-680A Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV on approach to MKE Runway 25L.,2017,12
336,201802,CALIFORNIA,WHILE INBOUND TO LAND AT RIO VISTA AIRPORT IN VMC; MY STUDENT PILOT AND I WERE SETTING UP TO APPROACH RUNWAY 7 AT THE 45 DEGREE ENTRY ANGLE TO THE DOWNWIND LEG.  I HAD JUST COMPLETED THE LANDING CHECKLIST AND A 10 NM ADVISORY RADIO TRANSMISSION ON CTAF 122.725. MY ATTENTION WAS IMMEDIATELY DRAWN TO A LARGE RC AIRCRAFT MAKING AEROBATIC MANEUVERS DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF MY AIRCRAFT APPROXIMATELY 800 FEET BELOW MY FLIGHT PATH AND WAS OPERATING WELL ABOVE THE 400 FT UAS FLIGHT ALTITUDE RESTRICTION. I WAS ALARMED TO SEE THE AIRCRAFT AT THIS ALTITUDE AND RECOGNIZED FLIGHT AT THIS ALTITUDE BY (UAS) IS PROHIBITED BY THE FAA. I DID NOT HAVE TO MAKE ANY EVASIVE ACTION. HOWEVER; I CONTINUED MY CONCERN ABOUT THE RA AIRCRAFT AND WHERE IT WAS HEADED SO I COULD AVOID EVASIVE ACTION OR COLLISION. BOTH I AND MY STUDENT SAW THE AIRCRAFT INITIALLY BUT WE DID NOT SEE THE AIRCRAFT AGAIN. THE FLIGHT TERMINATED AT RIO VISTA AIRPORT (O88) WITHOUT ANY FURTHER INCIDENT.AFTER LANDING I RESEARCHED INFORMATION VIA THE INTERNET. THERE IS A REMOTE-CONTROLLED AIRPORT NEAR ISLETON; CA. IN CONCLUSION; IT IS MY OPINION THE RC AIRCRAFT I WITNESSED EXCEEDING THE FAA ALTITUDE PROHIBITION WAS OPERATING FROM THIS LOCATION.,PA28 flight instructor landing at O88 airport reported observing a RC aircraft apparently operating outside of the charted parameters associated with the RC operations area.,2018,02
337,201802,CALIFORNIA,ON FINAL APPROACH (VISUAL APPROACH) TO OAK RUNWAY 30 AT APPROXIMATELY 1400 FEET MSL; WE NOTICED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A SMALL FLOCK OF BIRDS SLIGHTLY TO THE LEFT OF OUR APPROACH COURSE. IT WAS LOW AND LOCATED BETWEEN THE RUNWAY THRESHOLD AND THE AIRCRAFT.THE OBJECT(S) APPEARED TO BE BLACK IN COLOR CONTINUED TO CLIMB IN A SOUTHWEST BOUND DIRECTION OVER THE BAY. AT APPROXIMATELY 1200 FEET MSL; THE OBJECT BEGAN A RAPID ACCELERATION AND AGGRESSIVE CLIMB. THE AUTOPILOT WAS DISCONNECTED IN CASE ANY EVASIVE MANEUVERING WOULD BE NECESSARY. THE OBJECT MADE A RAPID WESTERLY CLIMBING MANEUVER PASSING OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT BETWEEN 1200 AND 1000 AGL. THE OBJECT BECAME CLEARLY VISIBLE AT THAT TIME; IT WAS A BLACK QUAD COPTER DRONE. THE DRONE PASSED OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT BY APPROXIMATELY 500 TO 1000 FT. WE IMMEDIATELY RELAYED THE INFORMATION TO THE TOWER AND CONTINUED THE APPROACH TO A NORMAL LANDING. DURING TAXI IN PROVIDED GROUND CONTROL WITH ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION; THEY REQUESTED. DRONE OPERATING WITHIN THE AIRPORT TRAFFIC AREA. IT APPEARS TO BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR AIRPORT AUTHORITIES TO SECURE THE AIRPORT AREA FROM INCURSIONS BY DRONES. CREW AWARENESS IS PROBABLY THE ONLY REALISTIC DEFENSE AGAINST SUCH INCIDENTS. DRONES MAY BECOME AS NUMEROUS AND HAZARDOUS AS BIRDS AND OTHER WILDLIFE THREATS.,MD-11 flight crew reported an Airborne Conflict with a drone during final approach for landing.,2018,02
338,201802,CALIFORNIA,WHILE CLIMBING THROUGH 5000 ON THE TRUKN2 DEPARTURE OFF OF 28L; I NOTICED A SMALL DRONE PASS APPROXIMATELY 300 FT BELOW AND 100 FT LEFT OF OUR AIRCRAFT. I NOTIFIED NORCAL DEPARTURE ON 120.9 AND THEY RELAYED THE INFO TO A FLIGHT DEPARTING BEHIND US.,A320 Captain reported a NMAC with a drone on departure from SFO.,2018,02
339,201802,CALIFORNIA,ON VISUAL APPROACH IN VMC FOLLOWING THE ILS 24R COURSE AT THE FAF CONFIGURED WITH GEAR DOWN AND FLAPS 20; A BRIGHT RED QUADCOPTER DRONE PASSED BELOW US LESS THAN 100 FEET FROM 12 O'CLOCK POSITION TO SLIGHTLY RIGHT OF NOSE. REPORTED IMMEDIATELY TO LAX TOWER WHO ISSUED AN ALERT TO A NEARBY POLICE HELICOPTER. UPON LANDING DID NOT OBSERVE ANY DAMAGE OR EVIDENCE THAT WE HIT THE DRONE. EVENT HAPPENED SO FAST THAT MY ALERT ON THE FREQUENCY WOULD HELP FOLLOWING AIRCRAFT TO BE ON LOOKOUT TO TAKE NECESSARY ACTION.,G450 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV on approach to Runway 24R at LAX.,2018,02
340,201802,CALIFORNIA,IN CRUISE ON A SIGHTSEEING FLIGHT AROUND MONTEREY PENINSULA. RADIO CONTACT WITH NORCAL FOLLOWING DEPARTURE FROM MRY. CEILING AND VISIBILITY UNLIMITED. ON NORTHBOUND TRACK OVER THE TOWN OF PACIFIC GROVE CAUGHT SIGHT OF A FAST MOVING DRONE SOUTHBOUND OFF MY RIGHT WING AND WITHIN 500 FT OF MY ALTITUDE. REPORTED SIGHTING TO NORCAL. THEY ASKED IF I WANTED TO MAKE A REPORT AND I REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. SEVERAL MINUTES LATER I HEARD A PILOT OF PIPER CHEROKEE SOUTH OF MY POSITION REPORTING WHAT I ASSUME WAS THE SAME DRONE PASSING HIM.,C172 pilot reported an airborne conflict with a UAV in the vicinity of MRY airport.,2018,02
341,201802,FLORIDA,ON ARRIVAL TO 18R AT MCO; NEAR OUTER MARKER; THE FIRST OFFICER REPORTED A DRONE TO THE RIGHT AND BELOW THE AIRPLANE. I DID NOT SEE THE DRONE; FIRST OFFICER (FO) STATED THAT IT WAS NEAR FINAL APPROACH; BUT BELOW OUR AIRPLANE. WE DID NOT REPORT IT AS A NEAR MISS; AS FO STATED THAT IT WAS NOT. THE FO IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE DRONE TO MCO TOWER.,A321 Captain reported a conflict with a drone near the outer marker of the approach to MCO airport.,2018,02
342,201802,FLORIDA,ON FINAL APPROACH INTO MCO; DRONE PASSED OFF OUR RIGHT WING ABOUT 100 FEET BELOW US AND BETWEEN 700-1000 FEET TO OUR RIGHT (WEST). DRONE IN CONTROLLED AIRSPACE NOT COMMUNICATING WITH ATC.,A321 First Officer reported an inflight conflict with a UAV on short final into MCO.,2018,02
343,201802,NEW YORK,WHILE ON APPROACH FREQUENCY; ATC ADVISED US OF AN UNAUTHORIZED DRONE ABOUT TWO MILES EAST OF GREKO AT 2000 FEET ON ILS 22. ON DOWNWIND; AT 4000 FEET ABOUT FOUR MILES EAST OF GREKO; WE PASSED THE DRONE. IT WAS ABOUT CO-ALTITUDE AND ABOUT 50- 100 YARDS OFF THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF AIRCRAFT. WE DID NOT HAVE TO MANEUVER. DRONE WAS ABOUT 3 FEET IN SIZE AND RED IN COLOR.,A319 flight crew reported a NMAC with a drone during their approach to LGA.,2018,02
344,201802,NORTH DAKOTA,AS I WAS PRE-BRIEFING FOR MY SHIFT; I WAS TOLD THAT THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT WAS FLYING A DRONE IN OUR CLASS D AIRSPACE JUST SOUTHWEST OF THE AIRPORT OVER A LARGE FIRE AT A FUEL TANK FARM. MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS THAT THE WEATHER WAS IFR AND IT DIDN'T SEEM RIGHT TO BE FLYING ANY UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEMS (UAS) IN A CLASS D IN IFR CONDITIONS. I THEN DID SOME RESEARCH; AND AFTER LOOKING THROUGH THE CERTIFICATE OF AUTHORIZATION (COA) AND OUR LOA WITH THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT; I SAW THAT THEY WERE ONLY AUTHORIZED TO FLY IN VMC CONDITIONS. I LOOKED AT THE PREVIOUS METARS FOR THE DAY AND SAW IT HAD BEEN IFR THE WHOLE DAY. THE VISIBILITY AT THE TIME WAS BELOW 2 MILES. THE NOTAM FOR THE UAS ACTIVITY STATED THE DEFINED AREA WAS A 2-MILE RADIUS FROM THE FAR126002 AND STATED THAT IT WAS 2.2 MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE WEST FARGO AIRPORT (D54) FROM SURFACE TO 400FT AGL. THE FAR126002 WOULD PUT THE AREA ABOUT 11 SOUTHEAST OF D54; BUT THE SMOKE FROM THE FIRE WAS VISIBLE FROM THE TOWER AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT IT WAS INDEED 2.2 SOUTHEAST OF D54. LATER IN THE EVENING; I TOOK A PHONE CALL FROM SOMEONE AT APPROXIMATELY 4.5 MILES SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF THE FARGO AIRPORT; OR AROUND 4 SOUTH-SOUTHEAST FROM D54. THE CALLER ASKED IF THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT CALLED TO NOTIFY US THAT THEY WERE FLYING A UAS. I ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THOUGH I DIDN'T RECEIVE A CALL; THAT I BELIEVED THEY DID CALL BEFORE MY SHIFT THAT DAY. THE CALLER SOUNDED CONCERNED BUT DIDN'T ASK ANYTHING FURTHER. I THEN REALIZED THAT THE SANFORD HOSPITAL HELIPORT WAS WITHIN THE DEFINED AREA OF THE UAS ACTIVITY. SINCE I DIDN'T TAKE THE CALL AND I WASN'T IN CHARGE OF THE FACILITY AT THE TIME; I ASSUMED EVERYTHING WAS BEING DONE CORRECTLY; BUT I DID RAISE MY CONCERN WITH THE SUPERVISOR ON DUTY THAT I QUESTIONED WHETHER THEY SHOULD BE FLYING IN IFR CONDITIONS. I BELIEVE THIS WAS AN UNSAFE SITUATION AS WE HAD IFR AIRCRAFT ARRIVING ON AN ILS APPROACH THAT GOT WITH A HALF MILE OF THE DEFINED AREA OF THE UAS ACTIVITY. THE DEFINED AREA ALSO HAD A RADIUS OF 2 MILES AND THE VISIBILITY WAS LESS THAN 2 MILES. I ALSO REALIZED AFTER THE CALL THAT THIS DEFINITELY COULD CONFLICT WITH A MEDEVAC FLIGHT OFF SANFORD HOSPITAL. WE WERE REQUIRED TO KEEP AIRCRAFT OUT OF THE DEFINED AREA OF THE UAS ACTIVITY. IF A MEDEVAC HELICOPTER WANTED TO DEPART SANFORD HOSPITAL; WHETHER IFR OR SVFR; WE WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ALLOW IT. THE NOTAM WASN'T CANCELLED UNTIL THE NEXT DAY IN THE MORNING. I RECOMMEND THAT PILOTS AND COA HOLDERS BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. IT SEEMS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS UNDER THE IMPRESSION THAT THEY CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT IN SITUATIONS LIKE THIS; BUT THERE ARE PROCEDURES IN PLACE FOR A REASON. THANKFULLY; NOTHING HAPPENED TO CONFLICT WITH THE UAS ACTIVITY IN THIS SITUATION; BUT THERE WAS POTENTIAL FOR SOMETHING DANGEROUS AND I WOULD NOT WANT TO BE THE ONE HELD ACCOUNTABLE OR THE ONE DENYING ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY BECAUSE THEY ARE BEING UNSAFE.,KFAR Tower Controller reported an Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) operating in class D; under IFR conditions; contrary to the Certificate of Authorization and LOA.,2018,02
345,201802,OHIO,WE WERE GIVEN A HEADING TO THE AIRPORT TO SET UP OUR APPROACH. WE BOTH NOTICED A SOLID BLUE BLOCK AIRCRAFT WITHOUT ALTITUDE ENCODING COMING DIRECTLY AT US LESS THAN FIVE MILES AWAY. WE CONTACTED APPROACH AND LET THEM [KNOW] WHAT WAS GOING ON AND ASKED FOR A DEVIATION TO THE LEFT TO AVOID THE UNKNOWN TRAFFIC. WE DID MAKE THE TURN; AND IT SEEMED THE AIRCRAFT WOULD HAVE HIT US. WE [WERE] IN THE BOTTOM OF THE CLOUDS AND COULD NOT SEE IT. AFTER WE PASSED THE AIRCRAFT WE CONTINUED TO THE APPROACH AND LANDED WITH NO FURTHER EVENT. I DID CALL ATC AND DISCUSSED THE EVENT. THEY SAID THEY HAD NO RADAR TARGETS. WE BOTH CAME TO THE CONCLUSION IT WAS A DRONE. NO FURTHER ISSUES.,CRJ-700 Captain reported an airborne conflict with what was believed a UAV in the vicinity of DAY airport.,2018,02
346,201802,SOUTH CAROLINA,I WAS WORKING RADAR WHEN TOWER CALLED TO COORDINATE DEPARTURES. I HAD A LAW ENFORCEMENT VFR AIRCRAFT AT 3200 FEET IN THE DEPARTURE CORRIDOR; SO I INSTRUCTED THE TRAFFIC TO REMAIN AT OR ABOVE 3000 FEET. I APPROVED TOWER TO LAUNCH DEPARTURES AT 2500 FEET. AIRCRAFT X DEPARTED FIRST. I WAITED UNTIL HE WAS PAST THE TRAFFIC BEFORE CLIMBING AND TURNING HIM TO A 360 HEADING AND CAPPED HIM AT 6000 FEET REFERENCE TRAFFIC AT 7000 FEET 15 MILES NORTH OF HIM. THEN SECOND DEPARTURE TOOK OFF AND WENT SOUTH. I SEPARATED THE SECOND DEPARTURE FROM THE TRAFFIC AND VECTORED HIM TO INTERCEPT A VICTOR AIRWAY. I THEN WENT BACK TO AIRCRAFT X; SCANNED AHEAD AND DID NOT OBSERVE ANY TRAFFIC IN HIS WAY. I CLEARED HIM TO 10000 FEET. I SPOKE TO MULTIPLE AIRCRAFT IN THE MEANTIME; REVECTORED MY SOUTHBOUND DEPARTURE TO INTERCEPT THE VICTOR AIRWAY ON A BETTER HEADING; AND THEN TURNED TO THE FDIO (FLIGHT DATA INPUT/OUTPUT) TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT. THAT'S WHEN I HEARD THE CONFLICT ALARM GO OFF IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO AIRCRAFT Y SOUTHEAST BOUND AT 7500 FEET. I OBSERVED AIRCRAFT X AT 7000 FEET; THEN RAPIDLY DROPPED IN ALTITUDE TO 6600 FEET. AT THAT TIME I INSTRUCTED AIRCRAFT X TO MAINTAIN 7000 FEET JUST BEFORE I OBSERVED THE ALTITUDE CHANGE TO 6600 FEET. AIRCRAFT X THEN ADVISED ME HE WAS TAKING EVASIVE ACTION.I BELIEVE I MISSED AIRCRAFT Y AT 7500 FEET DUE TO IT BEING OBSCURED BY FULL DATA BLOCK TRAFFIC THAT I WAS WORKING AT THE SAME POSITION OF THE UNIDENTIFIED LIMITED DATA BLOCK 7500 FEET. MAYBE IF THE FULL DATA BLOCK WOULD AUTO TOGGLE TO A DIFFERENT POSITION EVEN IF THE OTHER TARGET IS A LIMITED DATA BLOCK. I'M 100% SURE I SCANNED AHEAD PRIOR TO SENDING AIRCRAFT X ON COURSE AND CLIMBED HIM TO 10000 FEET; AND DID NOT SEE AIRCRAFT Y AT THE TIME I MADE THE TRANSMISSION.,CAE TRACON Controller reported a loss of separation after climbing an aircraft toward an unnoticed VFR aircraft.,2018,02
347,201802,TEXAS,FUELER PUT APPROXIMATELY 7300 LBS ON BOARD. FLIGHT PLANNED FOD (FUEL OVER DESTINATION) 2084. PLANNED; FILED; AND FLOWN AT 456 KTAS UNTIL COMING UNDER THE STAR SPEEDS. IAH WAS FORECAST AND SHOWING NE WINDS AT 15 KTS SO WE KNEW WE'D LAND EAST. WE DISCUSSED A LIKELY TIGHT FUEL SITUATION WHILE GETTING WINGS & TAIL DEICED FROM MORNING FROST. THERE WAS A 20 MIN DELAY FOR IAH ISSUED AFTER WE STARTED BOTH ENGINES SO WE SHUT ONE DOWN AS WELL AS THE APU TO CONSERVE FUEL BUT KEPT AN ENGINE RUNNING JUST IN CASE GROUND NEEDED US TO GET GOING SHOULD THE TIME MOVE UP.  TOOK OFF (DUAL ENGINE!) WITH APPROXIMATELY 6800 LBS ON BOARD. WE HAD A SHORT VECTOR TO THE SOUTH OF APPROXIMATELY 35 MILES (FOR SPACING) AT CRUISE BUT OTHER THAN THAT WE HAD NO DELAYS; HOLDS; SPEED SHIFTS; OR INTERMEDIATE LEVEL-OFFS IN THE CLIMB. AT TOC (TOP OF CLIMB) WE SAW THE FMS PREDICTING 1;500 LBS ON LANDING WITH THE APPROACH LOADED. WE KEPT AN EYE ON IAH WEATHER AND DISCUSSED IMMEDIATE DIVERSIONARY AIRPORTS SHOULD ATC SUGGEST ANY KIND OF DELAY.ATC CHANGED US TO THE GESNR ARRIVAL WHICH ISN'T MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE DOOBI WE WERE FILED ON. IN FACT; THE GESNR KEEPS YOU HIGHER FOR A LONGER TIME SO IT ACTUALLY HELPED. ON THE FILED FLIGHT PLAN; OUR TOD FROM THE PAPERWORK WAS 3 MILES PRIOR TO DOOBI. WE WERE FILED AND FLEW AT FL320. THE CHARTED ALTITUDE FOR THE ARRIVAL AT DOOBI IS BETWEEN 17;000 AND 15;000 FT. THIS TELLS ME THAT OUR PLANNED BURN IS OPTIMISTIC AND UNREALISTIC. WE DECLARED MIN FUEL WITH APPROACH ON THE DOWNWIND ABEAM THE AIRPORT. HE TOOK US OUT TO A 27 MILE FINAL BECAUSE MIN FUEL IS ESSENTIALLY MEANINGLESS TO ATC. FO (PILOT FLYING) DELAYED APPROACH FLAPS CONFIGURATION AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO REDUCE INCREASED BURN FOR DRAG.  WE BRIEFED GO-AROUNDS AND OUR IMMEDIATE PLANS SHOULD THAT OCCUR. WE LANDED WITH 1;280 LBS AND; AFTER A LONG TAXI; ARRIVED AT THE GATE WITH 1;180 LBS. WE ENJOYED MULTIPLE FUEL LO LEVEL WARNINGS DURING THE TAXI WHICH OCCASIONALLY MADE GROUND CONTROL'S COMMUNICATIONS DIFFICULT TO HEAR (THIS OCCURS AT APPROXIMATELY 1;200 LBS BUT YOU'LL GET IT IN EVERY TURN AS YOU APPROACH THAT QUANTITY). THIS WAS A NEW LOW FUEL LANDING RECORD FOR ME! MY PREVIOUS LOW WAS 1;400 LBS BUT THAT INVOLVED ACTUAL ISSUES OUTSIDE OF THE DISPATCH RELEASE (BLEED VALVE FAILURE). CAUSE- COMPANY FUEL SAVINGS PLAN COUPLED WITH POOR FUEL PLANNING - NEWER; LONGER DOWNWINDS BEING FLOWN FOR IAH - INADEQUATE DESCENT FUEL PLANNING WITH INCORRECT; WILDLY OPTIMISTIC TODS ON THE FLIGHT PLAN; CALM; MORNING FLIGHT WITH GOOD WEATHER THAT MADE ME THINK; 'YEAH; THESE FUEL NUMBERS LOOK GOOD.'ERRORS - ACCEPTING THE FUEL PLANNING UAS - EXTREMELY LOW FUEL QUANTITY DURING APPROACH AND LANDING (NOT QUITE EMERGENCY FUEL; THOUGH) PERSONAL IMPROVEMENTS - ENSURE 500 LBS MINIMUM TAXI FUEL DURING MORNING FLIGHTS THAT REQUIRE DEICING. MORE IF THERE'S ANY KIND OF HOLD-UP. IF IT'S NOT ON THE PAPERWORK; ADD IT AND INFORM DISPATCH. ENSURE THE TOD ON THE PAPERWORK IS IN A REALISTIC POSITION. IF NOT; ADD 300-500 LBS DEPENDING ON HOW WHACK. ADD THE FUEL AND INFORM DISPATCH.  IF I FOLLOWED THE ABOVE TWO NEW FUEL RULES; WE WOULD HAVE LANDED WITH 1;930 LBS. ENSURE FUEL ON DESTINATION IS NEVER LESS THAN 2;300 LBS. IF SO; ADD THE REQUISITE FUEL AND INFORM DISPATCH. DIVERT FOR A FUEL STOP WHEN THE FMS REALISTICALLY SHOWS LESS THAN RESERVE ON LANDING. IT'S REALLY NOT THAT MUCH WORK AND WE'RE PAID BY THE MINUTE; SO WHY NOT? MONEY IN THE BANK; BABY! COMPANY IMPROVEMENTS - RUN A STUDY ON TAXI FUEL NUMBERS. EVER SINCE THE FADEC UPDATE; OUR IDLE FUEL BURNS WENT FROM APPROXIMATELY 360 PPH TO 480 PPH BUT OUR PLANNED TAXI FUEL NUMBERS STAYED THE SAME. EVEN USING SINGLE-ENGINE TAXI; I'M OFTEN OVER THE PLANNED TAXI FUEL IF THERE'S ANYTHING OTHER THAN STRAIGHT-OUT-AND-TAKE-OFF. JUST MAKE 300 A MINIMUM TAXI FUEL (500 WHEN DEICING IS LIKELY) BECAUSE WE'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO DO THAT STUDY. GO BACK TO 1;800 LBS RESERVE. THE 1;650-1;700 LBS ONLY REALLY WORKS IF THE OTHER NUMBERS ARE ACCURATE. NOTHING INTHE LAST 3 YEARS INDICATES THERE IS ANY KIND OF ACCURACY IN OUR FUEL BURN NUMBERS. WORK WITH EMBRAER TO REPROGRAM THE EICAS LOGIC ON THE FUEL LO LEVEL MESSAGE. THIS SHOULD BE INHIBITED WHEN THERE'S WEIGHT-ON-WHEELS AND NO T/O DATA INPUTTED. THIS WILL PREVENT NUISANCE MESSAGES THAT MAKE HEARING ATC DIFFICULT.,Air Carrier Captain reported a low fuel situation that resulted from poor fuel planning and a delay for taxi at the departure airport.,2018,02
348,201803,CALIFORNIA,ON CLIMB OUT FROM RUNWAY 1R AT SFO FOR THE TRUKN2 NEAR TYDYE (OVER THE BAY) AT APPROXIMATELY 4700 FT MSL; I WITNESSED AN OBJECT TO THE RIGHT OF THE WINDSCREEN THAT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING. WHEN WE GOT CLOSER TO IT; THE OBJECT LOOKED LIKE A MID-SIZE DRONE SIMILAR TO A DJI INSPIRE 2 QUADCOPTER (I GOOGLED DRONES AFTER THE FLIGHT AND THIS ONE LOOKED THE CLOSEST). I REPORTED IT TO ATC WHEN I SAW IT AND THEY REPORTED IT TO THE TRAIL AIRCRAFT. I FLEW F-16S UP UNTIL A YEAR AGO WHERE WE ROUTINELY FLEW FORMATION AT 50-500 FEET AWAY FROM EACH OTHER; SO I CONSIDER MYSELF TO HAVE A GOOD GAUGE OF AIRCRAFT DISTANCES. I ESTIMATE WE PASSED WITHIN 500 FT FROM THE DRONE SINCE I WAS ABLE TO SPOT IT AND NOTE DETAILS ON THE SHAPE AND SIZE.,B757 flight crew reported sighting a UAV on departure from SFO.,2018,03
349,201803,CALIFORNIA,THE SAME EXACT SEQUENCE OF EVENTS OCCURRED ON PREVIOUS TRIP TO SAN. RUNWAY 27 WAS NOT IN USE AND NO NOTAM REGARDING SHORTENED LENGTH OF RUNWAY 27. GROUND CONTROL ISSUED CLEARANCE TO 'TAXI TO RUNWAY 27 VIA BRAVO.' APPROACHING THE END OF TAXIWAY BRAVO; MORE THAN ONE HALF THE NORMAL THROAT FROM BRAVO ONTO THE RUNWAY IS OBSTRUCTED WITH FLASHING RED BARRICADE. NEW RIGHT EDGE OF TAXIWAY AS YOU APPROACH HOLD SHORT LINE IS MARKED AND BLUE TAXIWAY EDGE 'PYLONS' FORM A DEFINITIVE BOUNDARY AND FORCE AIRCRAFT ONTO RUNWAY 27 APPROXIMATELY 500 FT FROM WHERE WE NORMALLY ALIGN AIRCRAFT FOR DEPARTURE (BY THE BLAST FENCE). AIRPORT DIAGRAM IS INACCURATE. CHART APPEARS TO SHOW TAXIWAY B1 COMING FROM THE WEST AND BEING THE MOST WESTERN PART OF PAVEMENT. TAXIWAY B1 IS ALSO MARKED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF TAXIWAY BRAVO AND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE LARGE THROAT NORMALLY AVAILABLE. THIS DISTANCE EQUATES TO 8;550 FT OF RUNWAY. THE FULL DISTANCE OF RUNWAY 27 IN THE PERFORMANCE DATA IS 9;401 FT. THE DIFFERENCE IS 551 FT. WITHOUT A NOTAM INDICATING RUNWAY 27 EAST OF B1 IS CLOSED AND WITH GROUND ISSUING A CLEARANCE TO TAXI TO RUNWAY 27 VIA BRAVO; THE CREW HAS NO KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PERFORMANCE THEY HAVE DERIVED FOR RUNWAY 27 (9;401 FT) IS WRONG. PERFORMANCE MUST BE CALCULATED FROM B1 BASED ON THE CURRENT UN-NOTAMED CLOSURE. THE DANGER IS THAT A CREW LOOKING AT ANY STOPPING MARGIN LESS THAN 1;051 FT WILL IN FACT HAVE LESS THAN 500 FT OF STOPPING MARGIN ON TAKEOFF. SAN IS A SHORT RUNWAY. ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT RUNWAY 27 SHOULD BE SELECTED AS NORMAL WHEN DERIVING PERFORMANCE. CREWS MAY ALSO MISUNDERSTAND THAT ANY RUNWAY SHORTENING IS ALREADY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PERFORMANCE DATA ONCE THEY VISUALLY SEE THAT NORMAL ACCESS TO THE RUNWAY IS OBSTRUCTED. PERFORMANCE DATA DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR AN UNIDENTIFIED SHORTENING. I RECOMMEND A NOTE BE IMMEDIATELY PLACED ON WEATHER PACKET AND MORE THAN ONE HALF THE NORMAL THROAT FROM BRAVO ONTO THE RUNWAY IS OBSTRUCTED RELEASE TO NOTIFY CREWS TO REQUEST PERFORMANCE DATA FOR RUNWAY 27/B1 TO AVOID THIS TRAP. ALSO RECOMMEND SAN AIRPORT OPS PUT A NOTAM OUT THAT THE FIRST 551 OF RUNWAY 27 NOT AVAILABLE FOR TAKEOFF. BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO DISCUSS. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO EXPLAIN IT ALL IN A REPORT.,B737 NG Captain reported the lack of NOTAMs regarding the shortened length of Runway 27 in SAN.,2018,03
350,201803,CALIFORNIA,I RESPONDED TO AN INCIDENT. I CHECKED THE AIRSPACE I WAS GOING TO LAUNCH THE UAS MAVIC DRONE AND I WAS IN ONTARIO AIRPORT'S CLASS C AIRSPACE. I MADE THE PROPER PHONE CALLS TO OBTAIN A WAIVER TO FLY NO MORE THAN 200 FEET TO TAKE AERIAL PHOTOS AND VIDEO. WHEN I RECEIVED THE PHONE CALL BACK WITH INFORMATION THAT A WAIVER WAS SUBMITTED AND NOTIFIED THEM I HAD A VO (VISUAL OBSERVER) FOR THIS FLIGHT OF NO MORE THAN .25 MILE RADIUS. I PERFORMED APPROXIMATELY A 10 MINUTE FLIGHT OVER THE INCIDENT AND NEVER EXCEEDED 150 FEET IN ALTITUDE. AFTER MY FLIGHT; I RECEIVED A PHONE CALL BACK THAT THEY WERE STILL WAITING FOR APPROVAL FROM THE FAA TO OBTAIN THE WAIVER. I THEN INFORMED THAT I WAS COMPLETED WITH THE FLIGHT OVER DERAILMENT AND THEN REALIZED THE WAIVER WAS NOT APPROVED AT THE TIME OF FLIGHT. THERE WAS COMMUNICATION FAILURE ON THE WAIVER AND THE PILOT MISUNDERSTOOD THAT THE WAIVER THAT WAS SUBMITTED WAS NOT A CLEARANCE FOR FLIGHT. WE HAVE LEARNED THAT THE ACTUAL WAIVER MUST BE PRINTED AND OBTAINED WITH THE DRONE PILOT BEFORE THE FLIGHT AND CONTACT WITH THE ATC MUST TAKE PLACE WITH A 10 MINUTE WAIT BEFORE TAKEOFF AFTER NOTIFYING THE AIRPORT AND THAT THE WAIVER IS IN HAND.,UAV Operator reported thinking he was cleared via a waiver to operate within ONT airspace; but after the flight determined the waiver had never been obtained.,2018,03
351,201803,CALIFORNIA,AS WE CROSSED THE FAF FOR RUNWAY 25L; MY FO SPOTTED A DRONE (A SMALL QUADCOPTER) HOVERING APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET BELOW THE AIRCRAFT. ATC WAS ADVISED OF THE DRONE SIGHTING. UPON ARRIVAL IN LAX A CALL WAS MADE TO DISCUSS THE DRONE SIGHTING.,EMB-175 Captain reported the First Officer sighted a UAV 200 feet below the aircraft on final approach to Runway 25L at LAX.,2018,03
352,201803,DC,CONDUCTED A 4 MINUTE FLIGHT FOR A ROOF INSPECTION. I MISINTERPRETED UAS FACILITY MAP DATA AND CONDUCTED FLIGHT IN CLASS B AIRSPACE OF IAD. VIOLATION WAS DISCOVERED DURING MONTHLY FLIGHT REVIEWS BY MY COMPANY'S DRONE DEPARTMENT. I THOUGHT THE NUMBER LISTED IN THE FACILITY MAP GRID BOX INDICATED THE FLOOR OF THE OVERLYING CONTROLLED AIRSPACE. I KNOW BETTER NOW.,UAV operator reported conducting a flight within IAD Class B airspace because he misread the chart.,2018,03
353,201803,FLORIDA,I WAS JUMPSEATING IN THE COCKPIT. [AT] 700 AGL; 2100 FT FROM THE RUNWAY; I NOTICED WHAT I FIRST THOUGHT WAS A BALLOON; STATIONARY OR MOVING FROM OUR 10:30 OR 11 O'CLOCK TOWARD OUR LEFT WING 9 O'CLOCK. I DID NOT SEE THE THREAT AS SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO DISTRACT THE PILOTS.  AS WE CONTINUED; AT ABOUT 700 AGL THE OBJECT; WHICH WAS NOW IN OUR 9:30 POSITION; AT OUR ALTITUDE; WAS CLEARLY A SMALL WHITE UAV. I ASKED THE PILOTS IF THEY SAW THE DRONE OFF TO THE LEFT AND THEY REPLIED THAT THEY DID NOT. THE DRONE WAS REPORTED TO THE TOWER WHO REQUESTED THAT WE CALL THE APPROACH CONTROL FACILITY. I REPORTED THE EVENT TO ATC; [THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT] OFFICE; AND EVENTUALLY TO THE FAA.,Captain; jumpseating on a B737; reported a close encounter with a small UAV on final approach which was not seen by the flying flight crew.,2018,03
354,201803,FLORIDA,WHILE FLYING THROUGH PATRICK AFB'S CLASS D AIRSPACE; I HAD A NEAR MISS WITH AN UNAUTHORIZED DRONE OPERATING WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE PATRICK AFB TOWER. THIS DRONE WAS LAUNCHED FROM AN AIR FORCE OWNED HOUSING ANNEX [WHICH IS] WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PATRICK AFB CLASS DELTA AIRSPACE. I NOTIFIED THE PATRICK AFB FLIGHT SAFETY DEPARTMENT AND TOWER ON TWO PRIOR OCCASIONS TO REPORT THE SAME ACTIVITY. I REPORTED THE NEAR MISS TO MLB TOWER AND THEY NOTIFIED THE PATRICK AFB TOWER DUE TO THE FACT THAT I WAS HANDED OFF TO THE MLB TOWER WHILE STILL INSIDE PATRICK AFB'S AIRSPACE. I ONCE AGAIN REPORTED THIS TO THE PATRICK AFB'S FLIGHT SAFETY DEPARTMENT AND REQUESTED THEY ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. AS A RESULT I WAS BARRED ACCESS FROM THE BASE.,Helicopter pilot reported a NMAC with a drone operating while traversing Patrick AFB's class D airspace.,2018,03
355,201803,HAWAII,I WAS TRANSITIONING NORTHWEST ABOVE ITO (HILO) AIRPORT AT APPROXIMATELY 5;300 FEET WHEN AN UNMANNED WEATHER BALLOON PASSED MY RIGHT SIDE AT EYE LEVEL ROUGHLY 150 FEET AWAY. I ANNOUNCED THIS EVENT TO THE APPROACH CONTROLLER ON DUTY.STRANGELY; THIS IS NOT THE FIRST; SECOND OR THIRD TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED TO ME IN THE SAME GENERAL AREA AND APPROXIMATELY THE SAME TIME OF DAY OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS. AT LEAST THREE; MAYBE MORE TIMES PRIOR; I HAVE HAD SOMEWHAT NEAR MISSES WITH THESE WEATHER BALLOONS. I FEAR THAT SOMEDAY; THIS WILL NOT BE A NEAR MISS. I DO NOT BLAME THE APPROACH CONTROLLER; AS THESE BALLOONS ARE COMPLETELY INVISIBLE TO HIM/HER; AND AFTER A SHORT TIME FROM LAUNCH THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE BALLOON BECOMES ENTIRELY UNKNOWN.I STRONGLY URGE THE FAA TO PARTNER UP WITH THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE AND MANDATE ADS-B OUT INSTALLATION ON FUTURE VERSIONS OF WEATHER BALLOON HARDWARE. THIS WOULD ALLOW ANY AIRCRAFT WITH ADS-B IN TO IDENTIFY AND AVOID THE BALLOONS; AND WOULD ALSO ALLOW ATC TO MONITOR THE BALLOON LOCATION THROUGHOUT ASCENT. THE EQUIPMENT REQUIRED IS ALREADY AVAILABLE AND IS INCREDIBLY SMALL AND LIGHTWEIGHT.,A helicopter pilot reported a NMAC with an unmanned weather balloon near Hilo airport.,2018,03
356,201803,ILLINOIS,DRONE SIGHTED BETWEEN 350-300 FEET AGL APPROXIMATELY 200-300 YARDS NORTH OF THE FINAL TO 09L. IT WAS INITIALLY IN MY 10 O`CLOCK POSITION FROM THE CAPTAIN'S SEAT AND MOVED VERY QUICKLY TO MY 8 O`CLOCK POSITION AS WE PASSED 300 FEET. HOVERED AND THEN MOVED ERRATICALLY AND VERY RAPIDLY WEST IN LEVEL FLIGHT PARALLEL TO FINAL APPROACH. DRONE WAS WHITE IN COLOR AND APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 2 FEET ACROSS. I CALLED IT OUT TO FIRST OFFICER WHO WAS HAND FLYING AND FOCUSED ON THE APPROACH.  ADVISED TOWER (THEY APPEARED QUITE BUSY). CONTINUED TO A NORMAL APPROACH AND LANDING.,A319 Captain reported a NMAC with an Unpiloted Aerial Vehicle on short final to ORD Runway 09L.,2018,03
357,201804,CALIFORNIA,DRONE SPOTTED AT 5000 MSL OFF RIGHT WING LESS THAN 20 FOOT CLEARANCE.  WE WERE ON VISUAL APPROACH CLEARANCE FOLLOWING APPROACH GUIDANCE.  FIRST OFFICER WAS PILOT MONITORING AND SPOTTED IT AT 1:00 POSITION WITH NO TIME TO NOTIFY ME AS IT PASSED OFF OUR RIGHT WING.  I NEVER SAW THE OBJECT WHICH HE DESCRIBED AS TEAL IN COLOR AND HAD A FLASHING RED STROBE ON TOP.  WE NOTIFIED ATC AND THEY BEGAN VECTORING THE TRAFFIC BEHIND US OFF COURSE SO AS TO NOT HAVE THE SAME ENCOUNTER.REQUIRE ALL DRONES TO HAVE TRANSPONDER AND FILE FLIGHT PLANS WHEN MORE THAN 500 AGL.,The pilot of an Embraer 175 aircraft reported a very close encounter with an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV); while conducting an approach to SAN. Though no evasive action was required; the event was immediately reported to Air Traffic Control.,2018,04
358,201804,COLORADO,I FLEW MY DRONE WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED FEET RADIUS OF MY PARENTS' HOUSE MAINLY KEEPING THE CRAFT PARALLEL TO THE ROAD THAT RUNS THROUGH THE NEIGHBORHOOD. I FLEW FOR ABOUT 15-20 MINUTES TOTAL. I WAS MOSTLY AT AN ALTITUDE BELOW THE TREE LINE; SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 10 AND 30 FEET. HIGHEST ALTITUDE ATTAINED WAS RIGHT AROUND 100 FEET FOR A FEW SECONDS. I WAS UNDER A FALSE IMPRESSION THAT I WAS ABLE TO FLY THE DRONE IN THE AREA; BUT NOW AFTER LOOKING AT SOME OF THE MAPS I AM NOT SO CERTAIN. I DID NOT DEFEAT ANY SAFETY DEVICES ON MY DRONE OR 'UNLOCK' ANY SOFTWARE TO FLY THERE. ONE MAP I'M LOOKING AT SHOWS THAT THE AIRSPACE IS NOT CLASS B; ANOTHER MAP I'M LOOKING AT SHOWS THAT IT IS; SO OUT OF CAUTION I WILL REFRAIN FROM FLYING THERE ANYMORE NOW THAT I KNOW I COULD POSSIBLY BE VIOLATING PROTECTED AIRSPACE. I AM A NOVICE WITH UNDER 1 HOUR OF FLIGHT TIME.,Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) operator reported that he was unsure whether he was in violation of FAR 107 while operating his drone due to ambiguity on the airspace charts.,2018,04
359,201804,FLORIDA,ON VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 19L; TRACKING GLIDESLOPE AND LOCALIZER. FOLLOWING A B737 [WHO] REPORTED TO TOWER THAT THEY HAD SPOTTED A DRONE TO THE RIGHT; BETWEEN 19L AND 19R LOW. THEY GAVE ME THIS WARNING. I SPOTTED THE LARGE YELLOW AND GRAY DRONE GOING BY 100 FEET ABOVE THE AIRCRAFT. REPORTED TO TOWER.,King Air pilot reported a NMAC with a UAV while on final approach to TPA.,2018,04
360,201804,ILLINOIS,A TV SHOW [WAS] ON THE O'HARE AIRPORT TVS IN OUR TERMINAL (IF NOT THE WHOLE AIRPORT). ON THAT SHOW; THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES COMPARED TO DIARRHEA... A CARTOON CHARACTER 'FLIPPING THE BIRD' ON SCREEN... IN OUR TERMINAL; FOREIGNERS VISITING FOR THE FIRST TIME; LITTLE KIDS; TWO NUNS. THESE PEOPLE - IN OUR TERMINAL - DO NOT SEE 'CITY OF CHICAGO CHANNEL CHOICE.' THEY SEE (OUR COMPANY). DO WE REALLY WANT TO PRESENT THIS IMAGE IN OUR DOMAIN? TO ME; THIS WAS A DESPICABLE DISPLAY THAT A CHICAGO EMPLOYEE DELIBERATELY SELECTED. UNACCEPTABLE.I ROUTE THIS WITH HIGH VISIBILITY BECAUSE; 1. IT WILL TAKE CORPORATE LEVEL PRESSURE (POSSIBLY COUPLED WITH AIRLINES IN THE TERMINAL) TO MAKE THE CITY MANAGEMENT LISTEN. 2 THE AIRPORT EXPERIENCE ALREADY HAS A REPUTATION FOR THE MOST NEGATIVE; TENSION-FILLED ENVIRONMENT MANY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE. DO WE REALLY NEED THE CITY ADDING HIGHLY CHARGED POLITICAL RANTS BEFORE A FLIGHT SO THAT AN ALREADY STRESSED PERSON CAN BECOME IRATELY DANGEROUS IN A CONFINED SPACE WITH OUR FLIGHT ATTENDANTS AND GATE AGENTS? THIS IS AVOIDABLE. GIVEN THE AVIATION SAFETY ANGLE; THIS ALSO FALLS WITHIN THE FAA'S PURVIEW TO GIVE O'HARE A 'THIS IS REAL' PHONE CALL.,Air carrier employee reported an undesirable and questionable television broadcast at the passengers' terminal in ORD.,2018,04
361,201804,LOUISIANA,UNMANNED DRONE PASSED NO MORE THAN 10 FEET BELOW AND 10 OUTSIDE THE RIGHT WING WHILE BEING VECTORED FOR APPROACH TO SHV. HEADING 170 DEGREES AT 3000 FEET. CAPTAIN SAW IT FLASH BY THE WINDOW ON THE RIGHT SIDE. FIRST OFFICER GOT A BETTER LOOK AND DESCRIBED IT AS A PROP-TYPE DRONE; ORANGE AND WHITE WITH A BLACK TOP. DRONE ALSO OBSERVED AND ALARMED A PASSENGER. PASSENGER ALSO DESCRIBED DRONE AS ORANGE AND WHITE.,Air Carrier Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV on approach to SHV.,2018,04
362,201804,NEW YORK,ON LOC AND GS FOR ILS RWY 13 AT LGA; AS THE PM. FULLY CONFIGURED; AT FINAL APPROACH SPEED (135-140 KIAS) AND  APPROXIMATELY 1200 FEET MSL; I NOTICED AN OBJECT AT 11:30 HIGH IN THE WINDSCREEN.  THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE TRIANGULAR IN SHAPE; RED AND BLACK COLOR; AND HAD THE CAPABILITY TO TURN ITSELF. AS WE WERE DESCENDING ON THE LOC; THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE CLIMBING AND TURNING LEFT; DIRECTLY ABOVE OUR FLIGHT PATH; ON A DIVERTING COURSE. AS WE NEARED; I BELIEVED IT TO BE FIXED WING DRONE; WITH A DELTA WING SHAPE; BUT UNSURE OF PROPULSION METHOD (FORWARD VS AFT MOTOR). NOTIFIED LGA TOWER THAT A DRONE WAS ON FINAL AT 1400 FEET.,Air Carrier flight crew reported passing under a UAV while on the ILS Runway 13 at LGA.,2018,04
363,201804,PENNSYLVANIA,AT APPROX. 1000'AGL; MY F/O SAID HE HAD SEEN WHAT LOOKED LIKE A DRONE GO BY.  I DO NOT KNOW HOW CLOSE OR WHETHER ABOVE OR BELOW - I WAS CAPT. AND PF.  I ASKED HIM TO REPORT IT TO THE TOWER AND HE DID.  UPON LANDING; ATC REQUESTED THAT WE CALL THEM WITH A NUMBER PROVIDED.  MY F/O ASKED IF I WANTED TO CALL AND SAID IT WOULD BE BETTER IF HE DID SO DIRECTLY SINCE I DID NOT SEE THE DRONE.  NO OTHER ACTIONS TAKEN.,Air carrier flight crew reported they had observed an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) go by the aircraft at about 1000  feet; while conducting an approach at the Philadelphia International Airport (PHL).,2018,04
364,201805,ARIZONA,I WAS WITH A STUDENT PILOT AND WE WERE PRACTICING FULL STOP TAXI-BACK LANDINGS AT IWA. WE WERE ESTABLISHED ABOUT ONE MILE WEST OF THE AIRPORT IN LEFT DOWNWIND FOR RUNWAY 30 LEFT. ONCE APPROXIMATELY MIDFIELD; THE LOCAL CONTROLLER GAVE US INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE A RIGHT 360 IN THE DOWNWIND FOR SEQUENCING WITH OTHER TRAFFIC AHEAD. MY STUDENT THEN READ BACK THE INSTRUCTIONS AND ESTABLISHED US IN A STANDARD RATE TURN TO THE RIGHT. BOTH MY STUDENT; WHO WAS PILOT FLYING IN THE LEFT SEAT AND MYSELF WERE LOOKING OUTSIDE FOR TRAFFIC WHEN ABOUT 270 DEGREES INTO THE RIGHT TURN WE BOTH NOTICED A SMALL OBJECT BELOW THE RIGHT WING AT APPROXIMATELY OUR 2-O'CLOCK POSITION MOVING LEFT TO RIGHT. INITIALLY I THOUGHT IT WAS A SMALL HELICOPTER AT A LOWER ALTITUDE BUT SHORTLY AFTER I OBSERVED A VERY BRIGHT FLASHING BLUE LIGHT ATOP A SMALL BLACK AIRCRAFT. DUE TO THE SIZE OF THE AIRCRAFT AND THE BRIGHT BLUE LIGHT ON TOP; I CONCLUDED THAT IT WAS A REMOTE CONTROLLED DRONE. AFTER MY STUDENT AND I BOTH SAW THIS OBJECT; HE CONTINUED HIS ROLLOUT TO RE-ESTABLISH HIMSELF IN THE DOWNWIND FOR RUNWAY 30 LEFT. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING IN VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY TO US IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN AT AN ALTITUDE THAT WOULD HAVE EASILY RISKED A COLLISION FOR LOCAL TRAFFIC PATTERN OPERATIONS. WE LUCKILY DID NOT HAVE TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION JUDGING BY THE DRONE'S SLIGHTLY LOWER ALTITUDE BUT INITIALLY IT VERY MUCH CAUGHT US OFF GUARD. I REPORTED THE SIGHTING IMMEDIATELY TO THE LOCAL CONTROLLER AND ESTIMATED TO HIM THAT THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT 300 FEET BELOW US. FOLLOWING THE FLIGHT AND SUBSEQUENT DEBRIEF BOTH MY STUDENT AND I CONCLUDED THAT THE OBJECT WAS VERY EASY TO SEE AND THAT IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 100 FEET LOWER THAN OUR DOWNWIND ALTITUDE OF 2600 FEET MSL. AFTER THIS INCIDENT; THE FLIGHT CONTINUED WITHOUT ANY MORE ISSUE. AFTER OUR FLIGHT CONCLUDED; ANOTHER STUDENT AT OUR FLIGHT SCHOOL TOLD ME HE ALSO SAW THE OBJECT AROUND THE SAME TIME WE REPORTED OUR SIGHTING TO THE CONTROL TOWER. I AM UNSURE IF HE HAS FILED A REPORT OR WHAT HIS POSITION WAS AT THAT TIME. I'M REALLY NOT SURE WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO AVOID THIS SPECIFIC INCIDENT EXCEPT TO MAKE THE PUBLIC MORE AWARE OF FLYING DRONES IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO AIRPORTS; TRAFFIC PATTERNS; AND APPROACH CORRIDORS AS WELL AS DEVELOP REGULATIONS FOR DRONE PILOTS REGARDING PROXIMITY OF THEIR FIGHT OPERATIONS NEAR AIRPORTS.,C172 instructor reported sighting a drone while in the traffic pattern at IWA airport.,2018,05
365,201805,CALIFORNIA,WHILE FLYING TO WVI AND STILL TALKING TO NORCAL AFTER EXITING SFO CLASS B; A SILVER DRONE PASSED ABOUT 50 FEET LEFT OF MY PLANE AND ABOUT 100 FEET BELOW. I WAS AT 4;500 FEET ON A HEADING OF ABOUT 140. I REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO THE NORCAL CONTROLLER WHO THEN ASKED A SERIES OF QUESTIONS WITH LOTS OF INTERRUPTIONS TO TALK TO OTHER TRAFFIC. HE WAS STILL GETTING INFORMATION FROM ME WHEN I ENTERED THE PATTERN AT WVI. THERE WAS CONSIDERABLE TRAFFIC AT WVI INCLUDING PARACHUTE JUMPERS AND A MERIDIAN WITH MINIMUM FUEL. I DIDN'T SWITCH TO THE WVI UNICOM UNTIL AFTER I HAD ENTERED A RIGHT DOWNWIND FOR RUNWAY 20 BECAUSE I WAS STILL PROVIDING DRONE INFORMATION TO THE CONTROLLER. I MISTAKENLY ENTERED A RIGHT DOWNWIND INSTEAD OF A STANDARD LEFT DOWNWIND PATTERN. IT DIDN'T CREATE ANY CONFLICTS; BUT WAS NOT CORRECT. I SHOULD HAVE STAYED AT CRUISING ALTITUDE AND COMPLETED MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE CONTROLLER BEFORE ENTERING THE PATTERN. I ALLOWED MYSELF TO BE VERY DISTRACTED AND WAS WAY BEHIND THE PLANE. THE ILLEGAL DRONE AND NEAR MISS WAS THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO CONTROL THE DRONE OPERATORS.,Pilot reported having a NMAC with a drone and subsequently being distracted during the entry to traffic pattern at WVI.,2018,05
366,201805,FLORIDA,WHILE WORKING LOCAL CONTROL SOUTH POSITION I APPROVED VEHICLE X TO INSPECT RUNWAY 12 FOR A POSSIBLE BIRD STIKE. AIRCRAFT X CHECKS IN FOR THE VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 12. I CLEARED AIRCRAFT X TO LAND RUNWAY 12. AIRCRAFT Y CHECKS IN FOR RUNWAY 09. I CLEAR AIRCRAFT Y TO LAND RUNWAY 9 AND HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY 12. I INSTRUCTED VEHICLE X TO HOLD SHORT OF RUNWAY 9 FOR AIRCRAFT Z LANDING RUNWAY 9 WITH THE ANTICIPATION THAT HE WOULD CROSS RUNWAY 9 AFTER AIRCRAFT Z LANDED. I ISSUED CROSSING INSTRUCTION TO AIRCRAFT A AND INSTRUCTED AIRCRAFT A TO CONTACT GROUND. GROUND CONTROL ASKED ME TO HAVE AIRCRAFT A TO JOIN TAXIWAY QUEBEC REFERENCE THEIR TRAFFIC. THE ASDE ALERTED THAT RUNWAY 12 WAS OCCUPIED AS AIRCRAFT X WAS OVER LANDING THRESHOLD. I THEN BEGAN A TRANSMISSION TO AIRCRAFT X TO GO AROUND AND REALIZED IT WAS TOO LATE AND THEN INSTRUCTED VEHICLE X TO EXIT THE RUNWAY IMMEDIATELY. THE MEMORY AID WAS IN USE. WHILE SCANNING THE RUNWAY I DID NOT SEE THE VEHICLE ON THE RUNWAY. I BELIEVE I FORGOT ABOUT THE VEHICLE HOLDING SHORT ON THE RUNWAY DUE TO HAVING AIRCRAFT EXITING THE RUNWAY AND CROSSING THE RUNWAYS. RECOMMEND HAVING A CAB COORDINATOR DURING THAT TIME OF NIGHT. DIFFERENT MEMORY AIDS FOR VEHICLE ON THE RUNWAY.,MIA Tower Controller reported aircraft landing while an airport vehicle was on the active runway.,2018,05
367,201805,KANSAS,[LOCAL] PARK COORDINATES OFFSET DISABLED. DRONE FAR OUT OF BOUNDS CAUSING WIND DRIFT INTO FENCED FIELD AND BATTERY DEPLETION. NO INJURIES. ADVISE ACCURACY CHECK OF FIELD COORDINATES.,A drone operator reported losing control of the drone after the unmanned aerial vehicle drifted too far out of range.,2018,05
368,201805,NEW JERSEY,WHILE ON FINAL APPROACH TO LANDING AT TETERBORO (TEB) ON THE ILS 19 AT APPROXIMATELY THE 1.5-2 DME AND ABOUT 900 FEET; WE DETECTED A DRONE LIKE OBJECT FLYING DIRECTLY UNDERNEATH US. THE DRONE WAS ABOUT 100-200 FEET BELOW US HEADING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION OF OUR FLIGHT PATH. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN; AS IT WAS NOT ON A COLLISION COURSE.WE NOTIFIED TOWER WHILE WE WERE STILL ON APPROACH TO LANDING. WE CALLED TOWER ONCE WE LANDED ON CELL PHONE TO GIVE THEM ALL THE DETAILS THEY NEEDED SO LAW ENFORCEMENT COULD BEGIN THEIR INVESTIGATION.,PC-12 Captain reported an NMAC with a Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) while on final approach to TEB airport.,2018,05
369,201805,NEW YORK,WHILE ON VECTORS FOR ARRIVAL AT EWR; WE WERE AT 5;000 FEET. I WAS FUNCTIONING AS PILOT FLYING (PF) AT THE TIME. I WAS DIVIDING MY ATTENTION BETWEEN THE INSTRUMENTS AND OUTSIDE AND SOMETHING CAUGHT MY EYE AHEAD; ABOVE AND TO THE RIGHT OF OUR COURSE. INITIALLY WHAT I WAS SEEING WAS CONFUSING; BUT I PUT MY HANDS ON THE CONTROL WHEEL AND THE AUTOPILOT DISCONNECT. AS WE GOT CLOSER; I REALIZED I WAS SEEING A DGI-STYLE DRONE. IT WAS CHARCOAL; A QUAD-COPTER WITH THE STANDARD GREEN AND RED LIGHTS. IT WAS 100 TO 200 FEET ABOVE US; HOVERING; APPARENTLY STATIONARY. THAT WOULD HAVE PUT IT AT AN ALTITUDE OF 5;100-5;200 FEET. IMMEDIATELY AFTER PASSING THE DRONE; I MADE A RADIO TRANSMISSION ASKING NEW YORK APPROACH TO MARK OUR LOCATION; [AND] THAT WE HAD PASSED CLOSE TO A DRONE APPROXIMATELY A MILE BEHIND US.I COULD NOT FIND ANY DOCUMENTATION ON WHAT ACTIONS A CREW SHOULD TAKE AFTER A DRONE SIGHTING LIKE THIS ONE. WE SHOULD HAVE SOME GUIDANCE IN OUR DOCUMENTATION FOR CREWS WHO ENCOUNTER A DRONE. I SUGGEST THAT WE HAVE A WAY TO REPORT THESE TO HELP THE FAA COLLECT DATA ON THESE SIGHTINGS. A RECURRING SIGHTING IN A LOCATION LIKE THIS ONE; APPROACHING EWR; MIGHT HELP PREVENT A DISASTER. IN THIS EVENT; A DRONE WAS ONLY A COUPLE HUNDRED FEET FROM A TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT. IT SEEMS THAT IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE AN IMPACT WITH A WINDSHIELD OR ENGINE INLET. CREWS NEED TO BE PREPARED TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION IF THE DRONE IS ON A COLLISION PATH WITH THE AIRCRAFT. THIS DEMONSTRATES THE NEED FOR VIGILANCE IN VISUAL SCAN WHEN POSSIBLE; AND HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED TO AVOID BEING COMPLACENT AND RELYING ON TCAS.,CRJ-900 First Officer reported a NMAC with a drone about 200 feet while on approach to EWR airport.,2018,05
370,201805,OHIO,WHILE ON A BASE LEG FOR THE ILS 1 AT CAK; I NOTICED A BLUE DRONE OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF MY WING. WE WERE AT 3;000 MSL AND THE DRONE APPEARED TO BE AT APPROXIMATELY 3;200 MSL. I NOTIFIED ATC IMMEDIATELY AND EVEN THEY FOUND IT AS A PRIMARY TARGET ON THEIR RADAR. THAT BEING SAID; THIS DRONE WAS WITHIN CLASS C AIRSPACE. NO DAMAGE OR INJURIES. THIS IS A ONE TIME EVENT THAT MAY BECOME A MORE FREQUENT EVENT WITH DRONE POPULARITY INCREASING.,Flight instructor reported a NMAC with a drone as they were turning base leg.,2018,05
371,201805,TEXAS,AIRCRAFT X WAS AN IFR ARRIVAL FROM THE WEST AND WAS GIVEN DIRECT TO THE FINAL APPROACH FIX FOR 13R DESCENDING TO 4000. I OBSERVED A TARGET DEPART 5C1 INITIALLY WESTBOUND. I CALLED TRAFFIC ABOUT 5 MILES FROM THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGET AND TURNED AIRCRAFT X TO THE LEFT TO AVOID THE TARGET. AS SOON AS I TURNED THEM TO THE LEFT; THE TARGET TURNED MORE TO THE NORTH MAKING THE SITUATION WORSE REQUIRING A LARGER TURN TO THE RIGHT FOR AIRCRAFT X. AFTER ALL WAS COMPLETE THE TARGET PASSED ABOUT 2 MILES EAST OF AIRCRAFT X. THE UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT WENT ON TO CONTINUE THEIR CLIMB UP THE LOCALIZER TO 13R FURTHER REQUIRING TRAFFIC CALLS FOR A B737.5C1 IS AN AIRPORT LOCATED ON A 15 MILE FINAL TO SAT 13R. 13R IS THE PREFERRED ARRIVAL RUNWAY AND IS THE MOST COMMONLY USED CONFIGURATION. THERE ARE DAILY TRAFFIC ALERTS AND SAFETY EVENTS WITH AIRCRAFT LANDING SAT AND AIRCRAFT DEPARTING AND ARRIVING 5C1. THERE IS A BROAD RANGE OF AIRCRAFT AT 5C1 FROM HIGH PERFORMANCE JETS TO GLIDERS MAKING THIS COMPLICATED AND EVEN DANGEROUS AT TIMES. IT IS COMMON PRACTICE FOR THESE AIRCRAFT TO DEPART AND ARRIVE AND AFFECT THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC INTO SAT. I BELIEVE AN AIRSPACE CHANGE THAT WOULD PUT A CEILING ON HOW HIGH UNIDENTIFIED NON-PARTICIPATING AIRCRAFT CAN CLIMB UNTIL THEY ARE EITHER TALKING WITH ATC OR AT LEAST CLEAR OF THE DOWNWINDS AND FINAL APPROACH COURSE OF SAT IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT THESE SAFETY ISSUES.,SAT Approach Controller reported having to vector an aircraft off an approach to avoid an unidentified VFR target departing from an adjacent airport underneath the final approach course.,2018,05
372,201805,TEXAS,AIRCRAFT X WAS ON A VECTOR TO JOIN FINAL. I OBSERVED TRAFFIC DEPART 5C1 AIRPORT WHICH IS LOCATED ON THE FINAL TO SAT 13R. THE TARGET DEPARTED INITIALLY TO THE WEST AND INITIALLY APPEARED TO BE NO FACTOR; BUT LATER TURNED TO THE NORTH CUTTING OFF AIRCRAFT X CAUSING AN RA FOR AIRCRAFT X. THE AIRCRAFT LATER CALLED AND REQUESTED AN IFR PICKUP AND REPORTED THE B737 IN SIGHT.SAT NEEDS A MODIFICATION TO THE AIRSPACE TO PREVENT THIS TYPE OF OPERATION. THIS IS A DAILY OCCURRENCE WHILE WORKING FINAL TO SAT. 5C1 AIRPORT HAS A VARIETY OF AIRCRAFT FROM LIGHT SPORT ALL THE WAY UP TO LEARJETS AS WELL AS A LARGE NUMBER OF GLIDERS. THE AIRPORT IS SITUATED 15 MILES NORTHWEST OF THE AIRPORT RIGHT ON THE FINAL TO THE MOST COMMONLY USED RUNWAY AT SAT. DUE TO THE LOCATION OF THIS AIRPORT AND THE PROXIMITY TO THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE TO SAT IT IS COMMON PRACTICE TO HAVE TO BREAK AIRCRAFT OFF OF THE APPROACH TO SAT TO BE RE-SEQUENCED DUE TO UNIDENTIFIED TRAFFIC MANEUVERING ON THE LOCALIZER TO 13R.,SAT Approach Controller reported a B737 on final approach received an RA for unidentified VFR traffic departing an adjacent satellite airport.,2018,05
373,201805,VIRGINIA,DESCENDING ON THE FREEDOM 4 STAR INTO DCA. 3RD AND LAST LEG OF THE DAY. WE HAD BRIEFED THE STAR AND WERE CALLING OUT THE ALTITUDE WINDOWS TO MEET BEFORE EACH FIX. AS WE APPROACHED APPROXIMATELY 15 NM TO WEWIL AND WERE AT 15500 FT I CALLED OUT TO CROSS IT AT OR ABOVE 14000 FT. FIRST OFFICER ACKNOWLEDGED AND SAID ROGER. AFTER THAT POINT WE BOTH BECAME DISTRACTED AND MISSED THE RESTRICTION. I NOTICED THAT WE WERE NOT YET AT WEWIL AND THE AIRCRAFT WAS AT 13400 FT. I CALLED IT OUT AND THE FIRST OFFICER TOOK THE FLIGHT CONTROLS AND CORRECTED WITH PITCH AND POWER TEMPORARILY CLIMBING A LITTLE BIT; BACK TO 13700 ISH. WE CROSSED WEWIL AND CONTINUED ON THE DESCENT; ATC ISSUED US A NEW FREQUENCY AND WE BECAME BUSY FROM THERE ON THE ARRIVAL. ATC NEVER CALLED US ON THE DESCENT ABOUT BEING TOO LOW. LANDED WITHOUT FURTHER PROBLEMS. MAIN THREATS WERE POTOMAC APPROACH AIRSPACE AND NIGHT TIME OPERATIONS WITH A COMPLEX OPD STAR. ERRORS WERE MY FAILURE TO STAY FOCUSED ON THE AIRCRAFT UNTIL PITCH AND POWER WAS CORRECTED SUCH THAT I COULD BE ASSURED THAT THE FIX ALTITUDE WOULDN'T BE BUSTED. UAS (UNDESIRED AIRCRAFT STATE) WAS THE AIRCRAFT BEING UNDERNEATH THE FLOOR OF ALTITUDE AT THE WEWIL FIX. BE MORE PROACTIVE ON THE FLIGHT DECK AND NOT ALLOW MY ATTENTION TO BE DISTRACTED FROM A THREAT WITHOUT SETTING A REMINDER.,EMB-145LR Captain reported overshooting an altitude restriction on the Freedom 4 STAR into DCA; citing the OPD complex procedure as contributing.,2018,05
374,201806,ARIZONA,DURING MY CLIMB FROM P20; THERE WAS A DRONE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT [AT] 4500 FEET VERY CLOSE TO THE AIRCRAFT. I WARNED OTHER TRAFFIC ON THE P20 TRAFFIC FREQUENCY AS WELL AS ON THE NORTHWEST TRAFFIC FREQUENCY.,Student pilot reported encountering a drone at 4500 feet after takeoff from Avi Suquilla Airport in Parker; AZ.,2018,06
375,201806,CALIFORNIA,DURING CLIMBOUT; ON THE SNTNA 2 DEPARTURE; AT APPROXIMATELY 13;500 FEET; A DRONE PASSED DOWN THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE COORDINATES OF THE ENCOUNTER WERE N3754.0/W12207.9. WE REPORTED THE ENCOUNTER TO ATC. ONLY THE FIRST OFFICER SAW THE DRONE. THOUGH DIFFICULT TO JUDGE THE EXACT DISTANCE; HE ESTIMATED THAT WE CAME WITHIN 200 FEET OF THE DRONE. WE WERE CLOSE ENOUGH TO IT THAT HE WAS ABLE TO CLEARLY SEE THAT IT WAS RED.,B757 Captain reported a NMAC with a drone while flying the SID; at approximately 13;500 feet and 50 NM East of the SFO airport.,2018,06
376,201806,CALIFORNIA,WHILE ON SIMULATED ENGINE FAILURE PRACTICE AT RHV; ON BASE TO FINAL TURN AT APPROXIMATELY 1000 FEET; WE SAW A WHITE DRONE OR QUAD COPTER. I TOOK OVER CONTROLS; TOOK EVASIVE ACTION; THEN ALLOWED THE STUDENT TO CONTINUE THE LANDING. ATC WAS NOTIFIED IMMEDIATELY AND A WARNING WAS GIVEN TO ALL PILOTS IN THE PATTERN.,Small aircraft pilot reported taking evasive action to avoid a quad-copter drone in the traffic pattern at RHV.,2018,06
377,201806,CALIFORNIA,AT FIVE DME INBOUND ON VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 25L; I SAW A WHITE 4-ENGINE DRONE PASS OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT BY APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET. HIS ALTITUDE WAS APPROXIMATELY 1200 FEET AGL. I REPORTED THE DRONE; AND THE AIRCRAFT FOLLOWING US REPORTED AFTER WE TOUCHED DOWN.,B737 captain reported sighting a drone close by the left side of his aircraft while on approach to runway 25L at LAX.,2018,06
378,201806,FLORIDA,I FLEW TODAY TO PRACTICE VFR MANEUVERS; PERFORM TOUCH-AND-GOES; AND MAINTAIN OVERALL PROFICIENCY. I CHECKED NOTAMS BEFORE FLIGHT; RECEIVED A STANDARD WEATHER BRIEFING FROM FOREFLIGHT; AND FILED A VFR FLIGHT PLAN. TO FLY IN THE LOCAL AREA; ALL FLIGHT OPERATIONS OCCUR IN THE VICINITY OF SEVERAL PRIVATE USE AIRPORTS (WITHOUT A CTAF FREQUENCY PRINTED ON THE VFR SECTIONAL CHART); [MILITARY AIRPORT] RESTRICTED AIRSPACE; MULTIPLE MOAS; MILITARY HELICOPTER TRAINING FLIGHTS; PARACHUTE JUMPING; AND UAV OPERATIONS. THESE HAZARDS OCCUR ROUTINELY THROUGHOUT THE AIRSPACE; REGARDLESS OF NOTAMS; AND CONSTANT PILOT VIGILANCE IS REQUIRED. IN ADDITION; THERE HAS BEEN A STANDING NOTAM FOR PARACHUTE JUMPING AT A PRIVATE AIRFIELD NEAR MY HOME AIRPORT.AS I WAS FLYING NORTH TODAY TOWARDS AN AIRPORT IN THE VICINITY OF THE PARACHUTE JUMP AIRFIELD; I NOTICED A PARACHUTE JUMPER ABOVE AND ABOUT 2 MILES AHEAD OF MY FLIGHT PATH. I TURNED EAST TO STAY WELL CLEAR OF THE JUMPER; AND I CONTINUOUSLY PERFORMED A VISUAL SCAN FOR A POTENTIAL JUMP PLANE; BUT SAW NO OTHER AIRCRAFT. I ALSO HAVE ADS-B IN/OUT INSTALLED IN MY AIRCRAFT'S PANEL; AND NO TRAFFIC WAS DISPLAYED PRECEDING THIS EVENT. AFTER APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER MINUTE OF ELAPSED FLIGHT TIME; A DESCENDING AIRCRAFT (ALONG WITH ITS TAIL NUMBER) EVENTUALLY APPEARED ON MY ADS-B DISPLAYS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO MY AIRCRAFT. HOWEVER; NEITHER MY TABLET DISPLAY NOR MY PANEL AVIONICS ANNUNCIATED AN AUDIBLE TRAFFIC CONFLICT WARNING.THIS EVENT REINFORCES THE LIMITATIONS OF BOTH VISUAL SEE-AND-AVOID AND ADS-B TRAFFIC DISPLAYS WHEN NON-COLLABORATING AIRCRAFT ARE MANEUVERING NEAR EACH OTHER. AS ALWAYS; PRE-FLIGHT PLANNING; SITUATIONAL AWARENESS; VISUAL SCANNING; AVIATE/NAVIGATE/COMMUNICATE PRIORITIES; AND CONSTANT VIGILANCE ARE PARAMOUNT TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS.,C182 pilot reported an airborne conflict with a skydiver and the descending parachute jump plane.,2018,06
379,201806,INDIANA,CRUISING AT 4500 FEET TO LAFAYETTE; I ENCOUNTERED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A DRONE AT THE LAST MINUTE AND HAD TO TAKE LAST SECOND ACTION IN ORDER TO MISS THE OBJECT. IT APPEARED TO BE BLACK AND RED AND WAS ROUGHLY 1 BY 1. THE OBJECT SEEMED TO BE HOVERING WITHOUT ANY MOVEMENT WHERE I ENDED UP MAKING A RIGHT 30-DEGREE BANK IN ORDER TO REMAIN SAFE. I CONTACTED SOUTH BEND APPROACH ASKING IF THERE WAS ANY DRONE NOTAMS; OR DRONE ACTIVITY IN THE AREA. I THEN RECEIVED A RESPONSE TELLING ME THERE SHOULDN'T BE. APPROACH THEN ASKED ME ABOUT THE INCIDENT; AND WHAT THE OBJECT APPEARED LIKE; [SO] TO ADVISE OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA.,Cirrus SR-20 pilot reported a NMAC during level flight at 4500 feet; which required evasive action.,2018,06
380,201806,KENTUCKY,AIRCRAFT X WAS ON ILS 6 APPROACH TO LONDON AIRPORT (LOZ) AND HAD JUST BEEN CLEARED WHEN THEY STARTED FLASHING WITH AN AIRCRAFT THAT WAS VFR UNIDENTIFIED (VFR1). I SAW NO REASON TO CALL TRAFFIC BECAUSE AIRCRAFT X HAD NO TURNED ONTO THE LOCALIZER AND VFR1 WAS FLYING AWAY FROM THE AIRPORT. THEY STOPPED FLASHING BUT I KEPT AN EYE ON VFR1. A COUPLE MINUTES LATER I NOTICED VFR1 WAS ON A HEADING THAT WOULD CROSS THE LOCALIZER AT 027 ALTITUDE. I CALLED THE TRAFFIC AND INFORMED THE PILOT THAT I DID NOT THINK TRAFFIC WAS A FACTOR BECAUSE VFR1 WOULD CROSS LOCALIZER AND BE OUT IN FRONT OF HIM BY 2 MILES. I STARTED A TRACK ON VFR1 AND NOTICED IT WAS TURNING DIRECTLY UP THE LOCALIZER. I DID A TRAFFIC ALERT; AND ADVISED AIRCRAFT X TO STOP HIS DESCENT. THE PILOT COMPLIED AND LEVELED AT 032; WHICH IS 500 FEET BELOW THE MVA. I THOUGHT MAYBE THEY WOULD FLY OVER VFR1 BECAUSE AT THAT TIME VFR1 WAS LEVEL AT 027. I THEN SAW VFR1 BEGIN TO CLIMB SO I TOLD AIRCRAFT X TO TURN 40 DEGREES LEFT AND CALLED THE TRAFFIC. PILOT COMPLIED AND AFTER ONE MORE TRAFFIC CALL; GOT VFR1 INSIGHT WITHIN 1 MILE AND SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET ALTITUDE. PILOT SAID VFR1 WAS TURNING INTO HIM AND ASKED TO TURN OTHER DIRECTION. I SAID 'APPROVED' ONCE THEY WERE CLEAR I OFFERED TO CLIMB THE PILOT BACK UP AND VECTOR BACK OUT TO THE APPROACH TO START OVER BUT THE PILOT SAID THEY WERE OK AND WERE READY TO CANCEL IFR. I KNOW I DID SEVERAL THINGS AGAINST REGULATIONS HERE. 1. NEVER CANCELLED HIS APPROACH CLEARANCE. -NEVER THOUGHT ABOUT IT UNTIL AFTER IT WAS OVER. WITH VFR1 MANEUVERING AROUND IN UNPREDICTABLE PATTERN; I JUST DID WHAT I FELT I NEEDED TO DO TO PREVENT COLLISION. CANCELLING APPROACH CLEARANCES IS SOMETHING HARDLY EVER DONE IN CENTER ENVIRONMENT; AND THE PROCEDURES FOR WHAT TO DO JUST DID NOT COME NATURALLY IN THE MOMENT. 2. TURNED BELOW MVA - AGAIN; I JUST DID WHAT I THOUGHT I HAD TO DO. I WOULD DEAL WITH THE MVA ONCE I FELT THE PLANES WERE SEPARATED.3. I JUST DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO ONCE THE PLANES WERE CLEAR. I KNEW AIRCRAFT X WAS BELOW THE MVA AND WAS NOT SURE HOW TO PROPERLY ADDRESS THE ISSUE OTHER THAN ASK THE PILOT IF THEY COULD GET BACK ON THE LOCALIZER AND LAND SAFELY; OR IF THEY WANTED TO CLIMB AND START FROM THE BEGINNING.THERE IS NO WAY TO PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING; BUT WE NEED TO REVIEW HOW TO HANDLE TRAFFIC ALERT SITUATIONS BELOW THE MVA. IT MAY HAVE BEEN COVERED; BUT IN PRACTICALITY WE NEVER SEE IT.,ZID Controller reported a BE35 on an ILS approach was in conflict with non-participating VFR traffic; requiring an avoidance vector below the Minimum Vectoring Altitude.,2018,06
381,201806,MINNESOTA,WHILE ON FINAL INTO MSP ON RUNWAY 12R; MY FIRST OFFICER NOTICED AN OBJECT TO THE LEFT OF OUR AIRCRAFT. WE WERE DESCENDING THROUGH 4;000 FEET AND THE OBJECT LOOKED TO BE AROUND 3;500 FEET AND APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET OFF OUR LEFT SIDE IT LOOKED TO BE BLACK AND SILVER IN COLOR AND APPROXIMATELY 3 FEET TALL. IT LOOKED TO BE MAINTAINING LEVEL FLIGHT AND POSSIBLY MOVING OPPOSITE OUR DIRECTION OF FLIGHT. ATC WAS NOTIFIED AND WE CONTINUED INTO MSP AND HAD A NORMAL LANDING.,Air carrier Captain reported a conflict with a UAV while on approach to MSP.,2018,06
382,201806,NEW JERSEY,JUST AFTER TAKEOFF EWR; CLIMBING THROUGH 3;300; ON NEW YORK DEPARTURE; WE PASSED A WHITE AND RED OR WHITE AND ORANGE DRONE; WITHIN 50 FEET OF OUR RIGHT WINGTIP. IN THE COUPLE OF SECONDS; IT FIRST APPEARED AS A MYLAR BALLOON; BUT AS IT PASSED OUR WINGTIP; IT WAS DEFINITELY A DRONE.,B737 Captain reported a near miss with a drone during climbout from EWR airport.,2018,06
383,201806,NEW JERSEY,WE PASSED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A WHITE AND RED/ORANGE DRONE ON CLIMBOUT DEPARTING RUNWAY 4L OUT OF EWR. THE DEPARTURE WAS THE EWR 2 AND I SIGHTED THE OBJECT PASSING 3;000-3;500 FEET AHEAD AND TO THE RIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT.  THE OBJECT THAT I BELIEVE TO BE A DRONE PASSED CLOSE OFF OUR RIGHT AND JUST ABOVE OR ABOVE AND SLIGHTLY OFF OUR RIGHT WING.,B737 First Officer reported a NMAC with a drone during an instrument departure from EWR.,2018,06
384,201806,NEW YORK,I WAS NEAR [AN] EVENT. I WAS MORE THAN 100 FEET AWAY FROM ANY PERSON(S) IN AN ISOLATED AREA; WEST OF THE MAIN STREET; BY RAILROAD TRACKS; FOR MY 3RD FLIGHT OF THE DAY; WHEN THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER (LEO) APPROACHED ME AND SAID THE STATE POLICE HAD A TFR OVER THE AREA. THE UAS WAS DIRECTLY OVERHEAD OF ME. I HAD AN OPERATING AVIATION BAND RADIO TUNED TO ROC TOWER. I LANDED IMMEDIATELY AND CURTAILED BY FLIGHT ACTIVITIES.MY TWO PREVIOUS FLIGHTS IN THE NEARBY AREA WERE AT LEAST THAT DISTANCE AWAY FROM PEOPLE; BOTH IN ISOLATED AREAS FOR TAKEOFF AND LANDING. I IMMEDIATELY RE-VERIFIED THAT THERE WAS NO TFR BY; A: AIRMAP.IO APP ON MY PHONE; B: FAA TFR WEBSITE AND; C: CALLING 1800-WXBRIEF AND TALKING TO A BRIEFER. I HAD PREVIOUSLY CHECKED FOR TFRS ON THE TFR.FAA.GOV SITE. I EVENTUALLY FOUND AND TALKED TO A STATE POLICE LEO AT THE [EVENT] AND HE DIDN'T KNOW OF ANY TFR. HE SAID THERE MAY BE A STATE POLICE DRONE AROUND THAT MIGHT BE USED; IF NEEDED. HE GAVE ME A PHONE NUMBER OF THE (LOCAL) STATE POLICE OFFICE. I CONTACTED THEM. THEY NEEDED TIME TO LOOK INTO IT. WHILE WAITING; I APPROACHED TWO OTHER LOCAL LEOS AND INFORMED THEM OF WHAT THE ORIGINAL LEO SAID. THEY DIDN'T KNOW OF ANY TFR. THEY DID MENTION THAT THEY KNEW OF THE STATE POLICE DRONE AND THAT IF IT WAS USED; IT LAUNCHED ON AN UPPER FLOOR OF A NEARBY OFFICE BUILDING. THEY CONTACTED THEIR SUPERIOR AND WHILE ON THE PHONE WITH HIM; THEY LEARNED OF MY CONTACT WITH THE LOCAL STATE POLICE OFFICE. THEY WERE UNABLE TO RESOLVE THIS. A BIT LATER; I RECEIVED A CALL BACK FROM THE STATE POLICE OFFICE. I WAS TOLD THAT THERE WAS A STATE POLICE DRONE ON LOCATION; AND IF FLOWN WAS OPERATED BY A STATE POLICE OFFICER. I WAS TOLD THAT THEY HAD CONTACTED THE NE FAA (?) REGIONAL OFFICE. I WAS TOLD THAT HE SAID BECAUSE THE STATE POLICE HAD A DRONE IN THIS AREA (NOT WITHSTANDING IT WAS NOT AIRBORNE); THAT I COULD NOT FLY WITHIN 5 MILES; DUE TO SOMETHING CALLED LIKE; THE 'FAA DRONE SAFETY ACT' (?); WHICH I CANNOT FIND ANY REFERENCE TO. THAT IF I WERE FLYING MY DRONE AND THEN THEY WANTED TO FLY; I WOULD BE INTERFERING WITH THEM. SOMETHING ABOUT THEY (STATE POLICE) OWNING THE SKY. I WAS ALSO TOLD THAT IF THEY SAW ME FLYING NEAR THERE; DURING THE [EVENT] TIME; THEY WOULD ONLY TAKE MY INFORMATION AND TURN IT OVER TO THE FAA. I HAVE CHECKED THE 1800WXBRIEF.COM; UAS OPERATING MAP FOR THE AREA AND THERE IS NO UAS NOTAM FILED BY THE STATE POLICE; ONLY THE USUAL ONES THAT; I PRESUME; BY THE SYRACUSE AREA MILITARY OF OVER 60NM RADIUS. THERE AREN'T ANY LOCAL (COUNTY; CITY; VILLAGE) DRONE LAWS FOR THE AREA THAT I KNOW OF. TO CONCLUDE; I DON'T KNOW WHAT LAW THEY ARE REFERRING TO ABOUT INTERFERING WITH LEOS AND WHAT RIGHT LEOS HAVE OVER PART 107 OPERATORS WHEN THE LEO UAV IS NOT AIRBORNE AND THE LEO HAVEN'T EVEN FILED A NOTAM FOR A SCHEDULED EVENT. I AM WELL AWARE OF THE FAA'S POSITION OF NOT INTERFERING WITH AN ACTIVE LEO OPERATION. I DO NOT BELIEVE ONE WAS ACTIVE AT THE TIME. IT TOOK ME QUITE A WHILE TO TRACK DOWN THE STATE POLICE LEO ON SCENE. HOWEVER; I AM FILING THIS NASA REPORT; JUST IN CASE.,Drone operator reported being informed by a local law enforcement officer that the State police had TFR in effect; however; the operator could not source any publication of the TFR from neither NOTAMs; nor a weather briefer.,2018,06
385,201806,OREGON,AFTER BEING CLEARED INTO CLASS DELTA AIRSPACE FOR LANDING AT HIO; AND INSTRUCTED TO DESCEND BELOW 700 FEET MSL; I HAD A NEAR MISS WITH A DRONE OVER HIGHWAY 26; 4NM ENE OF HIO. I WAS AT APPROXIMATELY 650 FEET MSL AND THE DRONE WAS ABOVE ME; JUST TO THE RIGHT OF MY 12 O'CLOCK. I TURNED LEFT UPON SEEING IT AND GOT A GOOD LOOK AT IT. IT APPEARED TO BE GREY IN COLOR AND POSSIBLY OF THE DJI PHANTOM TYPE OF QUADCOPTER. I HAVE SEEN PLENTY OF THESE AND IT LOOKED TO BE THAT STYLE. I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED TO THE TOWER THAT I HAD A NEAR MISS AT THE EDGE OF THEIR AIRSPACE AND GAVE THEM APPROXIMATE LOCATION; ALTITUDE; AND DESCRIPTION OF THE UAV. I WAS TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY 120 KTS IAS; WITH LIGHT WINDS AND GOOD VISIBILITY OTHER THAN LIGHT SMOKE IN THE AREA FROM PRESCRIBED BURNS. I HAD TWO PASSENGERS ON BOARD; ONE IN THE FRONT WITH ME AND ONE DIRECTLY BEHIND THAT PASSENGER.,Helicopter pilot reported a NMAC with a quadcopter drone at approximately 650 feet MSL while inbound for landing.,2018,06
386,201806,TEXAS,VISUAL CONDITIONS ON VKTRY2 RNAV ARRIVAL. WAS CLEARED DIRECT TO YOHAN FOR ILS 18R AND THEN CLEARED DIRECT TO LEGRE (ESTIMATING 15NM FROM LEGRE AND 230 KNOTS); STILL DESCENDING TO 3;000 FEET. ONCE ESTABLISHED DIRECT LEGRE AND DESCENDING THROUGH 8;000-8;200 FEET; [I] SAW WHAT I INITIALLY THOUGHT WAS A BIRD ON THE NOSE; SLIGHTLY CROSSING CENTER TO LEFT. AS OBJECT PASSED; IT WAS CLEAR IT WAS A QUAD COPTER DRONE. HAPPENED FAST BUT THOUGHT IT WAS GREY BOTTOM AND BLACK TOP. PASSED APPROXIMATELY 50-100 FEET OFF THE LEFT WING AND SLIGHTLY (25 INCHES) HIGH. MADE REPORT IMMEDIATELY WITH APPROACH CONTROL AS IT HAPPENED. WAS ASKED IF I WAS SUBMITTING A 'NEAR MIDAIR REPORT' PRIOR TO SWITCHING TOWER AND I REPLIED YES.,B737-800 pilot reported near miss with a drone while on initial approach at approximately 8;000 feet altitude.,2018,06
387,201806,TEXAS,VISUAL CONDITIONS ON VKTRY2 RNAV ARRIVAL. WE WERE CLEARED DIRECT TO YOHAN FOR ILS 18R AND THEN CLEARED DIRECT TO LEGRE (ESTIMATING 15NM FROM LEGRE AND 230 KNOTS); STILL DESCENDING TO 3;000 FEET. ONCE ESTABLISHED DIRECT LEGRE AND DESCENDING THROUGH 8;000-8;200 FEET CAPTAIN SAW A QUAD COPTER DRONE. WE MADE REPORT IMMEDIATELY WITH APPROACH CONTROL AS IT HAPPENED. WAS ASKED IF WE WERE SUBMITTING A 'NEAR MIDAIR REPORT' PRIOR TO SWITCHING TOWER AND CAPTAIN REPLIED YES.,B737-800 First Officer reported a NMAC with a drone while flying the ILS Runway 18R approach into DFW; at approximately 8;000 feet and 25 NM north of DFW.,2018,06
388,201807,CALIFORNIA,WHILE DESCENDING TOWARDS SAN LUIS OBISPO; I NOTICED A DRONE PASS OVER MY LEFT WING WITHIN 100 FEET. I WAS DESCENDING THROUGH 2500 FEET AT THE TIME; NEAR CAL POLY UNIVERSITY; ROUGHLY 4NM NORTH OF THE SAN LUIS AIRPORT. I ONLY SPOTTED THE DRONE FOR A SECOND BEFORE IT DISAPPEARED PAST MY WING AND THUS DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO MANEUVER AWAY FROM IT.,C172 pilot reported a NMAC with a drone while descending into SBP.,2018,07
389,201807,CALIFORNIA,I WAS WORKING THE R-SIDE AT SECTOR XX. I CLIMBED AIRCRAFT X AND HAD A J-RING ON AIRCRAFT Y. AT THE TIME WHEN I CLIMBED AIRCRAFT X I THOUGHT I HAD ENOUGH ROOM TO CLIMB HIM WITH NO PROBLEM. AIRCRAFT Y WAS HEADED IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. I GOT BUSY DESCENDING AIRCRAFT FOR ZZZ AND ZZZ1. TRAINING WAS GOING ON AT THE D-SIDE POSITION AND THE TRAINEE WAS HAVING A HARD TIME KEEPING UP SO I WAS DOING A LOT OF THE ENTRIES AND TELLING THE TRAINEE WHAT TO DO. I FEEL LIKE IF I HAD A CPC D SIDE OR SOMEONE MORE EXPERIENCED HELPING IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASIER TO TRACK EVERYTHING. AIRCRAFT Y WAS IN A AREA OF HIGH TRAFFIC VOLUME AND DENSITY. POSSIBLY TRAFFIC WITH ZZZ2 ARRIVALS AND DEPARTURES AND OVERFLIGHTS IN THAT AREA. ALSO WITH HIM MANEUVERING THERE IN THE FUTURE I WILL USE VERTICAL SEPARATION AND ASSIGN A HEADING TO AIRCRAFT Y. MY COMFORT LEVEL WITH AIRCRAFT Y IS LOW AND THOUGHT HE WOULD BE ABLE TO TURN FASTER.,ZOA Center Controllers reported a loss of separation between a UAV and a Small Transport.,2018,07
390,201807,ILLINOIS,ON FINAL FOR RUNWAY 28C IN CHICAGO; AT APPROXIMATELY 1700 FEET AND 5 DME FROM THE LOCALIZER; WE CAME IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A DRONE JUST SOUTH OF THE APPROACH COURSE. DRONE APPEARED TO BE WITHIN ABOUT 200 FEET OF THE AIRCRAFT. WE DID NOT HAVE TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. REPORTED THE DRONE TO TOWER WHO WE THEN CONTACTED VIA PHONE AFTER ARRIVAL AT THE GATE.,CRJ-200 First Officer reported a UAV in close proximity to the aircraft.,2018,07
391,201807,MASSACHUSETTS,AIRCRAFT X HAD NEAR MISS WITH A SMALL DRONE OFF RIGHT WING ABOUT 150 FEET AWAY AT 200 FEET AGL PARALLEL TO RUNWAY 32 AND THE SHORE LINE.,B737 First Officer reported an NMAC with a drone during approach to BOS.,2018,07
392,201807,MICHIGAN,ON FINAL APPROACH TO ARB RUNWAY 24 FLYING A CESSNA C172 I NOTICED INITIALLY AT 1:00 O'CLOCK POSITION (HORIZONTAL) A BRIGHT 'CANDY APPLE RED AND BRIGHT CHROME' 4 ENGINE DRONE. CONTINUED ON FINAL APPROACH PASSING DRONE. DRONE REMAINED STATIONARY IN 3D SPACE AS WE PASSED. NOTIFIED ARB TOWER OF DRONE HOVERING ON ARB FINAL APPROACH.,C-172 pilot reported a NMAC with a drone while on final approach to Ann Arbor Municipal Airport.,2018,07
393,201807,MONTANA,DRONE IN VICINITY OF AIRPORT: WE WERE AT 400 FEET AGL OFF OF RUNWAY 26 IN HVR AND BEGAN REDUCING THE POWER FOR NORMAL CLIMB AND BEGAN OUR TURN TOWARD THE SOUTHEAST. UPON ENTERING THE TURN; I SPOTTED WHAT WAS CLEARLY A PERSONAL DRONE (DJI PHANTOM) OFF OUR LEFT WING AT 150 FEET AWAY AND 50 FEET LOWER THAN OUR ALTITUDE. I ALERTED THE CAPTAIN ABOUT THE DRONE; HE MADE THE SAME ASSESSMENT ABOUT THE DRONE SIGHTING UPON SEEING IT. WE THEN GOT ON THE CTAF TO LET OTHER POTENTIAL TRAFFIC IN THE AREA ABOUT THE DRONE APPROXIMATELY 1 MILE WEST OF THE FIELD. HVR UNICOM ASKED FOR MORE DETAILS; WE GAVE THEM THE ABOVE STATEMENT. UPON REACHING A HIGHER ALTITUDE; WE CHECKED IN WITH SALT LAKE CENTER; ASKED FOR VFR FLIGHT FOLLOWING AND GAVE THEM THE REPORT OF THE DRONE SIGHTING.,Pilot reported airborne conflict with a drone approximately 400 feet AGL after takeoff from Havre City-County Airport; Montana.,2018,07
394,201807,NEVADA,AIRCRAFT X; (AS350) EUROCOPTER EXPERIENCED A DRONE STRIKE APPROXIMATELY 1 NM SOUTH OF CXP. ALTITUDE UNKNOWN. PILOT IN COMMAND (PIC) REPORTED THOUGHT IT WAS A BIRD STRIKE; BUT DID NOT FIND EVIDENCE OF BIRD. REPORTED SOUND OF AN OBJECT STRIKING THE AIRCRAFT AND SUBSEQUENT VIBRATION IN TAIL SECTION. PIC MADE AN IMMEDIATE LANDING ON THE CXP SOUTH RAMP. FOLLOW-UP INSPECTION BY COMPANY MECHANIC REPORTED BENT TRIM TAB AND LOCATED DINGS ON FUSELAGE WHERE OBJECT STRUCK THE AIRCRAFT. REPAIR CONDUCTED OVER NEXT TWO DAYS. AIRCRAFT DEPARTED CXP AFTER TWO DAYS. FAA FSDO (RNO) NOTIFIED ON MORNING AFTER TWO DAYS. I WAS INSTRUCTED TO CONTACT CARSON CITY SHERIFF'S OFFICE AND REQUEST DEPUTY TO TAKE A POLICE REPORT.,An airport worker at CXP reported a midair collision between a helicopter and a drone.,2018,07
395,201807,NEW HAMPSHIRE,WHILE DESCENDING THROUGH 19;200 FEET MSL ON THE ORW7 ARRIVAL INTO BOS; I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BALLOON COMING TOWARDS OUR AIRCRAFT. A FEW SECONDS LATER AS WE FLEW DIRECTLY UNDER IT; MISSING IT BY ABOUT 10-20 FEET; WE NOTICED IT WAS A DRONE. IT WAS DIRECTLY ABOVE MY WINDSHIELD (THE FO SIDE) AND PROBABLY ABOUT 2 FEET WIDE. WE WERE APPROX 24NM WEST OF PVD VOR.  I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED BOS CENTER AND THEY PROCEEDED TO VECTOR OTHER AIRCRAFT AWAY FROM THAT AREA. BOS CENTER GAVE US THEIR NUMBER TO CALL THEM ON THE GROUND FOR FURTHER INFORMATION. I CALLED AND SPOKE WITH BOS CENTER MANAGENT AND PROVIDED THE INFORMATION [THEY] REQUESTED IN ADDITION TO MY CONTACT INFORMATION.,ERJ-190 flight crew reported a NMAC with a Drone during the descent phase of flight.,2018,07
396,201808,CALIFORNIA,WE WERE ON SHORT FINAL FOR 27 IN SAN. A MILITARY AIRCRAFT SEEMED TO BE HOVERING ONE OR TWO MILES SOUTH OF OUR PATH. I WAS HAND FLYING THE APPROACH WHEN THE F/O (FIRST OFFICER) MENTIONED THAT THE CRAFT COULD BE A DRONE. IT WAS; AND THEREFORE MUCH CLOSER TO OUR PATH THAT WHAT WE ORIGINALLY BELIEVED. IT STAYED AT A FAIRLY SAFE DISTANCE AND I REFOCUSED ON LANDING THE AIRCRAFT. AN AIRCRAFT WAS CLEARED FOR IMMEDIATE TAKEOFF AND SEPARATION WAS TIGHT. DURING THE LANDING ROLL; THE DRONE REAPPEARED IN MY PERIPHERAL VISION AS IT PASSED US ON THE TAXIWAY. WHEN WE CLEARED THE RUNWAY; IT WAS NOW HOVERING OVER AN (OTHER CARRIER) AIRCRAFT IN OUR 12 O'CLOCK POSITION AT [THE] TERMINAL. I ADVISED THE TOWER OF THE ENCOUNTER AND ITS PRESENT LOCATION. THE DRONE WAS BLACK; PROBABLY TWO OR THREE FEET WIDE. IT WAS BEING FLOWN IN A VERY SKILLED WAY. THE HOVERING AND FLIGHT PATH WAS PRECISE. IT WAS A PROFESSIONAL INSTRUMENT; NOT A TOY. IN MY OPINION; THE INTENT WAS COMMERCIAL; PERHAPS FILMING. THAT IS WHERE I WOULD LEAD AN INVESTIGATION.THIS ENCOUNTER HIGHLIGHTS A SAFETY ISSUE OF THE HIGHEST LEVEL. A DRONE THAT SIZE CAN BE USED IN A TERMINAL AREA OF A MAJOR US AIRPORT WITHOUT THE KNOWLEDGE OF ATC. ONE OR MORE CAN BE USED TO CAUSE CATASTROPHIC DAMAGE TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. THE SKILL LEVEL OF DRONE OPERATORS AS WELL AS THE MANEUVERABILITY CAPABILITY CAN BE THE GREATEST HAZARD WE FACE. THE SAME EVENT AT NIGHT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNKNOWN FROM ANYONE. THIS IS AN EYE OPENER. IT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED.,B737 Captain reported sighting a drone while flying a visual approach to runway 27 at SAN and then again hovering over a parked airplane upon landing.,2018,08
397,201808,CALIFORNIA,ON APPROACH TO RUNWAY 24R AT LAX; APPROXIMATELY 2.9 MILES FROM JETSA AT 2500 FT WE ENCOUNTERED A DRONE AT OUR ALTITUDE. THE DRONE PASSED APPROXIMATELY 25FT ON THE RIGHT WING OF THE AIRCRAFT; SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE WING BUT AT OUR ALTITUDE. WE IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED ATC AND PROVIDED A DESCRIPTION OF THE DRONE AND THE APPROXIMATE LOCATION AND ALTITUDE. WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO DEVIATE AND ONLY SAW THE DRONE AT THE LAST SECOND. PASSENGERS WERE UNAWARE AND THE FLIGHT LANDED NORMALLY.,Citation Captain reported a NMAC with a drone while on approach to Runway 24L at LAX.,2018,08
398,201808,COLORADO,UPON APPROACH TO THE AIRPORT; I SAW THAT A BALLOON WAS BASICALLY ON THE EXTENDED CENTERLINE OF RUNWAY 01; SO I EXTENDED MY BASE LEG TO GIVE THE BALLOON PLENTY OF CLEARANCE. ALSO; MY [FELLOW PILOT] WAS ON A TIGHT BASE LEG; AND FLEW THAT LEG ON THE INSIDE (AIRPORT SIDE) OF THE BALLOON. AS I COMPLETED MY DEVIATION AROUND THE BALLOON AND RE-INTERCEPTED THE EXTENDED CENTERLINE WHILE DESCENDING ON THE GLIDE PATH; WELL PAST THE BALLOON; THE BALLOON PILOT MADE A CALL ON UNICOM; IMPLYING I HAD COME TOO CLOSE TO HIS AIRCRAFT. PERHAPS I DID NOT MEET HIS SPACING EXPECTATION; BUT I HAVE A FAIR AMOUNT OF AVIATION EXPERIENCE. AT NO TIME DID I PASS WITHIN 1;000 FEET OF HIS BALLOON.,C182 pilot reported maneuvering on final to avoid a balloon.,2018,08
399,201808,COLORADO,I THOUGHT I WAS IN UNCONTROLLED AIRSPACE. I LATER FOUND OUT THAT I WAS 3 BLOCKS INTO IT. NOW THAT LANC [LOW ALTITUDE AUTHORIZATION AND NOTIFICATION CAPABILITY] IS FULLY FUNCTIONAL; I WILL GET FAMILIAR WITH IT AND BE SURE TO USE IT WHEN DOING INSPECTIONS.,UAV pilot reported being unaware the flight conducted was in controlled airspace.,2018,08
400,201808,DELAWARE,IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING A NORMAL APPROACH AND LANDING; ON LANDING ROLL NOTICED OBJECTS ON RUNWAY WHICH WERE TURNED OUT TO BE A LARGE FLOCK OF GEESE. I THOUGHT I WOULD BE SLOWED ENOUGH AND THEY WOULD START TO MOVE SO THAT WITH THESE TWO FACTORS OCCURRING; THERE WOULD BE NO CONFLICT. HOWEVER; SINCE IT WAS A GRASS RUNWAY; AND WHILE NOT WET; I DID NOT WANT TO APPLY MAXIMUM BRAKING ON A 'SOFT' FIELD AND RISK A LOSS OF CONTROL. SINCE THEY DID NOT EXPEDITE THEIR DEPARTURE; I RAN THROUGH THEM; STRIKING FIVE WITH PROPELLER AND GEAR DOOR. I DO NOT THINK ANYTHING OTHER THAN A REDUCED GEESE POPULATION COULD PREVENT THIS. I RETROSPECTIVELY THOUGHT ABOUT IF A LOW APPROACH TO INSPECT FIRST WOULD HAVE BEEN USEFUL TO AVOID THIS. BUT I THINK THIS WOULD HAVE POSITIONED ME TO POTENTIALLY BE FLYING THROUGH A DEPARTING FLOCK AT HIGH POWER; HIGHER SPEED; AND LOW ALTITUDE IN DARK CONDITIONS RESULTING IN A MUCH LESS FAVORABLE OUTCOME. I HAVE BEEN FLYING TO THIS FIELD AND HAVE NOT PREVIOUSLY NOTED FLOCKS OF BIRDS ON THE RUNWAY WHILE LANDING.,BE33 pilot reported multiple bird strikes during landing rollout.,2018,08
401,201808,MISSOURI,WHEN CROSSING THE FINAL APPROACH FIX TO RUNWAY 12R AT 2400 FT ON A VISUAL APPROACH; WE SPOTTED A BLACK COLORED DRONE HOVERING APPROXIMATELY 400 FT BELOW US AND JUST TO THE RIGHT OF OUR APPROACH PATH. WE THEN REPORTED IT TO THE STL TOWER CONTROLLER UPON LANDING.,B737 Captain reported sighting a drone 400 feet below and just to the right of final approach fix to Runway 12R at STL.,2018,08
402,201808,TEXAS,DURING OUR CLIMB OUT OF IAH ON THE STYCK 6 DEPARTURE OUR COCKPIT JUMPSEATER SAID THAT WE OVERFLEW A BLACK QUAD COPTER DRONE. OUR ALTITUDE WAS ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND FEET AND CLIMBING; AND WE ESTIMATED THAT THE DRONE ALTITUDE WAS ABOUT 3500-4000 FEET. WE REPORTED THIS TO ATC AND CONTINUED ON TO OUR DESTINATION.,Air Carrier Captain reported sighting a quadcopter drone at approximately 4000 feet while flying the STYCK6 departure out of IAH.,2018,08
403,201808,TEXAS,WE WERE OPERATING TO ELP. THE FIRST ERROR IN THIS CHAIN OF EVENTS IS WHEN I NOTICED WE WERE LEVEL AT 8;000 FEET AT AN INDICATED AIRSPEED OF 280 KNOTS GOING DIRECT TO AGUAS. I POINTED OUT TO THE CAPTAIN THAT WE NEEDED TO REDUCE OUR AIRSPEED IMMEDIATELY. SHORTLY THEREAFTER WE BEGAN OUR SPEED REDUCTION WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO BEGIN A DESCENT TO 6;000 FEET AND CLEARED VISUAL 22. AT THIS PRESENT TIME WE WERE APPROXIMATELY 250 KNOTS DESCENDING AND ROUGHLY 16-17 MILES FROM THE FIELD. THE CAPTAIN WAS UTILIZING SPEED BRAKES DURING THIS DESCENT AND ASKED FOR SLATS TO BE EXTENDED AT 240 KNOTS. FROM THAT POINT FORWARD I TRIED TO BACK THE CAPTAIN UP WITH CONFIGURING AS EARLY AS PERMISSIBLE WITH RESPECT TO AIRCRAFT LIMITATIONS. WITH THAT BEING SAID; WHILE I WAS DOING MY JOB TO BACK HIM UP; I WAS NOT NEARLY ASSERTIVE ENOUGH IN MY OTHER DUTIES MAKING HIM AWARE OF OUR AIRCRAFT STATE WITH REGARD TO OUR STABILIZED APPROACH CRITERIA. I MENTIONED THAT WE WERE 'HIGH' AND 'FAST'; HOWEVER; IF I SAID WE WERE 'UNSTABILIZED' I DON'T RECALL IT. AT THE VERY LEAST I CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE I WASN'T SAID ASSERTIVE ENOUGH IF IT WAS MENTIONED. I THINK THE CAPTAIN AND MYSELF HAD TUNNEL VISION WITH GETTING THE AIRCRAFT CONFIGURED AND ON SPEED. I THINK THERE WAS SOME EXPECTATION BIAS AS WELL THAT PLAYED INTO THAT WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO FLYING SO MANY APPROACHES WHERE THE FAF IS 2-4 MILES FURTHER OUT THAN THIS PARTICULAR APPROACH INTO ELP. COUPLED WITH THE HIGHER ALTITUDE/HIGHER TAS ALSO COMPOUNDED THE CHAIN OF EVENTS THAT LED TO THIS UNSTABILIZED APPROACH. AS FAR AS WHAT CAUSED THE EVENT. AS CREWS WE KNOW THAT NO SINGLE INSTANCE CAN CAUSE THE OUTCOME OF SOMETHING. IN THIS CASE I THINK WE WERE LEFT A LITTLE HIGH BY CENTER CONTROL (SOME IN PART DUE TO SOME ATC ISSUES) AND THEN ON OUR OWN DOING OF BEING AT SUCH A HIGH SPEED AT 8;000 FEET AND A HIGH ALTITUDE AIRPORT. A POTENTIAL SECOND CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TODAY WAS THAT THIS WAS ONLY OUR SECOND LEG TOGETHER. AS IS WITH EACH NEW TRIP WITH A COWORKER YOU TRY AND GET A FEEL FOR HOW THEY FLY THE AIRPLANE AND WHEN THEY LIKE TO CONFIGURE FOR APPROACH TO LANDING. I NEEDED TO BE MORE ASSERTIVE OR JUST ASK HIM WHEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO SLOW DOWN AND CONFIGURE FOR APPROACH; SO THAT WE ARE SHARING THE SAME MENTAL MODEL. I ALSO HAD LATE VAN IN BUT THE NIGHT PRIOR; AND WAS ONLY ABLE TO GET ABOUT 2 HOURS OF SLEEP IN THE SORT. IT'S HARD TO ALSO IGNORE THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF FATIGUE AS A POTENTIAL CONTRIBUTING FACTOR. OUR EVENING WAS A LATE DUTY DAY AND WE WERE 22 MINUTES LATE ARRIVING.,Widebody Transport flight crew reported being high and fast and not meeting stabilized approach criteria before landing.,2018,08
404,201808,TEXAS,ON SHORT FINAL TO RWY 18R AT DFW AT 200 FT AGL I SAW A SMALL WHITE DRONE PASS UNDER OUR NOSE FLYING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. WE TOOK NO ACTION SINCE IT DIDN'T POSE AS A THREAT. IT WAS MAYBE 100-150 FT BELOW US. IT APPEARED TO BE FLYING OVER THE CONSTRUCTION AREA NEAR THE APPROACH END OF RWY 18R. I ADVISED ATC AND THEY HAD THE NEXT FEW AIRCRAFT LAND ON RWY 18L.,Air carrier Captain reported a small white drone pass under his aircraft flying in the opposite direction.,2018,08
405,201808,VIRGINIA,HYPER 7 RNAV (STAR) OVER YACKK @ 4;000 FT. FIRST OFFICER STATED AS HE WAS LOOKING FORWARD/DOWN AND SOMETHING CAUGHT HIS ATTENTION. HE STATED 'AS WE PASSED OVER IT; LOOKING DOWN AT APPROXIMATELY 1;000 FT BELOW US' IT APPEARED TO BE A DRONE. THIS WAS REPORTED TO APPROACH CONTROL. AFTER LANDING RWY 1R; IAD TOWER REQUESTED A VERBAL DESCRIPTION AND THE FIRST OFFICER DESCRIBED SEEING THE CROSS PATTERN OF THE DRONE FROM ABOVE; HALF MILE NORTH OF YACKK.,B-777 flight crew reported passing over a drone by 1000 feet while at 4000 feet on the HYPER 7 ARRIVIAL into IAD.,2018,08
406,201809,COLORADO,UPON LANDING IN DEN; WE HAD A POTENTIAL BIRD STRIKE. THIS WAS LEG THREE OF FOUR; WITH GROUND TIME SCHEDULED FOR ONE HOUR. AFTER ARRIVAL AT THE GATE AND POST FLIGHT DUTIES; I WENT OUTSIDE TO INSPECT THE AIRCRAFT FOR A BIRD STRIKE WHICH NONE WAS FOUND. UPON RETURNING TO THE FLIGHT DECK; I BEGAN PREPARING FOR THE NEXT FLIGHT WHILE THE CAPTAIN WAS IN THE TERMINAL. SINCE IT WAS GREATER THAN 30 MINUTES TO PUSH; I COULDN'T COMPLETE ALL MY PREFLIGHT DUTIES; SPECIFICALLY GETTING THE ATC CLEARANCE. I THEN STOOD UP IN THE FLIGHT DECK AND WAS JUST STANDING WAITING FOR THE CAPTAIN TO RETURN; BECAUSE I WANTED TO TAKE A WALK AS WELL. WHILE STANDING; I CONTINUED TO ACCOMPLISH PREFLIGHT ITEMS. I SET THE ALTITUDE WINDOW TO 10;000 FEET; WHICH IS THE HOLD DOWN ALTITUDE FOR ALL SIDS IN DEN. I SET THE CABIN PRESSURIZATION PANEL FLIGHT ALTITUDE TO 39;000 FEET; AND THEN INADVERTENTLY SET THE LANDING ALTITUDE TO 10;000 FEET INSTEAD OF 1;000 FEET WHICH WAS THE CORRECT SETTING FOR LANDING AT OUR DESTINATION. I BELIEVE THIS ERROR OCCURRED BECAUSE OF SETTING THESE ALTITUDES OUTSIDE MY NORMAL FLOWS AS I USUALLY MAKE THESE SETTINGS AFTER RECEIVING THE CLEARANCE. ALSO; I'M USUALLY SITTING; LOOKING UP AT THE CABIN PRESSURIZATION PANEL NOT STANDING WHEN MAKING THESE SETTINGS. THE CAPTAIN RETURNED TO THE FLIGHT DECK AND I TOOK A WALK AND RETURNED AS WELL. ALL REMAINING PREFLIGHT DUTIES WERE COMPLETED INCLUDING THE BEFORE START CHECK WHERE WE DID NOT CATCH MY ERROR. THAT EXTRA ZERO BETWEEN 1;000 FEET AND 10;000 FEET IS ABOUT THE WORST COMBINATION OF NUMBERS TO SET INCORRECTLY AND WAS EASILY OVERLOOKED. NOT SAYING THAT I WAS FATIGUED; BUT IT WAS THE FOURTH LEG AND STARTING TO GET DARK; WHICH MAY HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO THE ERROR. THE TAKEOFF WAS UNEVENTFUL AND DURING THE 10;000 FEET CLIMB CHECK; THE CABIN WAS PRESSURIZING NORMALLY TO THE BEST OF MY RECOLLECTION. HOWEVER; WE AGAIN DIDN'T CATCH THE LANDING ALTITUDE ERROR. CRUISE WAS UNEVENTFUL. DURING OUR DESCENT (MID-TWENTIES ON THE ALTITUDE) THE CABIN ALTITUDE WARMING LIGHT ILLUMINATED AND THE INTERMITTENT WARNING HORN SOUNDED. WE ACCOMPLISHED THE MEMORY ITEMS AND REQUESTED A DESCENT WITH ATC AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER BEGAN THE QRC CHECKLIST FOR THE CABIN ALTITUDE WARNING HORN AND LIGHT; AND EMERGENCY DESCENT. THE MODE SELECTOR WAS PLACED IN MANUAL AND THE OUTFLOW VALVE WAS HELD IN FULL CLOSED. THE HORN STOPPED; AND THE LIGHT HAD GONE OUT AFTER ABOUT 10-15 SECONDS; BUT WE CONTINUED DESCENT TO 10;000 FEET; NOT KNOWING WHAT WAS HAPPENING. UPON REACHING 10;000 FEET; WE REMOVED OUR MASKS AND BEGAN INVESTIGATING THE PROBLEM. THIS IS WHERE WE DISCOVERED THE LANDING ALTITUDE WAS SET INCORRECTLY. I SET THE CORRECT SETTING TO 1;000 FEET AND WE WERE GIVEN FURTHER STEP-DOWN DESCENTS TO PATTERN ALTITUDE. WE ASKED FOR EXTENDED VECTORS TO BRING THE PRESSURIZATION DIFFERENTIAL AND CABIN ALTITUDE DOWN AND THEN RETURNED THE MODE SELECTOR TO AUTOMATIC. WE THEN LANDED AND TAXIED TO THE GATE.CHECKLIST DISCIPLINE AND VVMI PROCEDURES WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THIS ERROR. WE READ THE CHECKLIST STEPS AND VERBALIZED THE RESPONSE; BUT NEED TO VERIFY RESPONSE IS CORRECT FOR THE SETTING.,B-737 First Officer reported a Cabin Altitude Warning during descent as a result of setting the wrong landing airport elevation in the cabin pressurization panel.,2018,09
407,201809,INDIANA,AIRCRAFT X WAS LEVEL AT FL210 AND ASKED ME IF THERE WAS ANY KNOWN DRONE ACTIVITY IN THE AREA. I RESPONDED; 'NEGATIVE; WHY?' HIS RESPONSE WAS; 'WE JUST WENT RIGHT BY ONE. IT WAS BIG AND BLACK'. I ASKED THE PILOT IF IT WAS THE TYPE WITH 4 ROTORS TO WHICH HE RESPONDED AFFIRMATIVE. I HAD AN AIRCRAFT CLIMBING IN THAT SAME GENERAL AREA SO I REPORTED IT TO HIM TWO TIMES. UPON LEAVING MY SECTOR THE CLIMBING AIRCRAFT SAID HE NEVER SAW IT. I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED IT TO THE FLM [FRONT LINE MANAGER] AND HE PROCEEDED TO DO HIS CHECKLIST AND PAPERWORK. APPROXIMATELY 5 MIN AFTER THE INCIDENT THE FLM HAD ME ASK THE PILOT IF HE COULD TELL WHAT DIRECTION THE UAV WAS TRAVELING AND IF HE CONSIDERED IT TO BE A NEAR MISS. THE PILOT SAID IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING IN ONE SPOT AND THAT HE CAME WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 50 FEET OF IT; AND HE DEFINITELY CONSIDERED IT A NEAR MISS. I LOOKED THE SITUATION UP IN THE 7110.65 LATER AND DISCOVER THAT ADVISORIES ARE SUPPOSED TO BE BROADCAST EVERY 4 MIN AFTER THE LAST REPORT; SIMILAR TO A LASER EVENT. WE HAVE NOT HAD PROPER TRAINING ON UAV ACTIVITY SO I WAS UNAWARE OF THIS REQUIREMENT. [RECOMMEND] PROPER TRAINING ON UNAUTHORIZED UAV ACTIVITY.,Indianapolis Center Controller reported an NMAC between a Piper and a drone; and also failure on Controller's report to broadcast for 15 minutes afterward.,2018,09
408,201809,MARYLAND,I WAS DROPPING OFF A GROOM AND HIS BEST MAN FOR A WEDDING AT A VENUE WITH A TIGHT LANDING AREA. IT WAS A SHORT FLIGHT; AND AFTER COMMUNICATING WITH TOWER I BEGAN MY HIGH RECON OF THE LANDING AREA. I HAD DONE BOTH A SATELLITE IMAGERY REVIEW AND A SITE VISIT PRIOR TO THE LANDING; BUT THERE WAS A NEW OBSTACLE I HAD NOT EXPECTED TO ENCOUNTER. ONE OF THE GROOM'S FRIENDS HAD A DRONE THAT HE WAS HOVERING IN THE PARKING LOT. NOT 100% SURE OF THE TYPE BUT IT WAS A SMALL FOUR ROTOR SYSTEM SIMILAR TO DJI PHANTOM WITH A CAMERA UNDERNEATH. I HAD NOT THOUGHT TO COMMUNICATE TO THE GROOM AHEAD OF TIME OF THE NEED TO KEEP ANY SMALL UAS ON THE GROUND DURING THE LANDING. I DID SAY TO THE GROOM DURING THE FLIGHT; 'HE NEEDS TO KEEP THE DRONE ON THE GROUND.' AS I SHIFTED MY FOCUS BACK DOWN TO THE GROUND I SAW THE UAS WAS IN HIS HAND AND IT LOOKED LIKE HE WAS WALKING IT BACK TO HIS TRUNK. AT THE SAME TIME THE GROOM WAS ON THE PHONE AND I HEARD HIM SAY 'THE PILOT SAID TO KEEP IT ON THE GROUND.' I DECIDED AT THAT TIME TO CONTINUE THE APPROACH; AND CONDUCTED A STEEP APPROACH INTO THE LANDING AREA TO REMAIN CLEAR OF THE TREES AND OBSTACLES IN THE AREA. AFTER LANDING; I ROLLED DOWN THE THROTTLE TO BRING ROTOR RPM TO IDLE AND HAD THE GROOM AND HIS BEST MAN EXIT OUT OF THE HELICOPTER WALKING FORWARD OF THE HELICOPTER. WHEN I SHIFTED MY ATTENTION BACK FORWARD I SAW THE DRONE BACK IN THE AIR; ABOUT 10 FEET IN FRONT OF ME AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE MY ROTOR SYSTEM. I LEANED MY HEAD OUT OF THE AIRCRAFT AND MADE EYE CONTACT WITH THE OPERATOR WHILE POINTING AT HIM; THEN THE DRONE. I MADE A HAND SIGNAL TO BACK AWAY FROM THE AIRCRAFT; AND THE DRONE MOVED AWAY FROM THE HELICOPTER AND BACK DOWN TO A ONE FOOT HOVER BEFORE SETTING BACK DOWN ON THE GROUND. AT THAT POINT I CONTACTED TOWER FOR TAKEOFF CLEARANCE; BROUGHT MY RPM BACK UP TO FLIGHT AND EXITED THE LANDING AREA USING A MAX PERFORMANCE TAKEOFF.IT IS POSSIBLE COMMUNICATION WITH THE GROOM PRIOR TO THE EVENT TO KEEP ANY AERIAL VIDEOGRAPHERS ON THE GROUND DURING THE LANDING AND TAKEOFF WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE OCCURRENCE; BUT IT IS POSSIBLE THE DRONE OPERATOR NEVER COMMUNICATED HIS INTENT TO FILM THE LANDING TO THE GROOM. WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR MORE EFFECTIVE WOULD HAVE BEEN TO HAVE GROUND PERSONNEL THERE FOR THE LANDING TO DIRECTLY COMMUNICATE WITH THE OPERATOR AND STRESS THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING THE DRONE ON THE GROUND TO PREVENT EITHER A MID-AIR COLLISION OR THE DRONE BEING THROWN BY THE ROTOR WASH INTO PEOPLE OR OBJECTS. HOWEVER; WE HAD LIMITED STAFFING DUE TO THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND AND ALL AVAILABLE COMPANY PERSONNEL WERE TASKED. I HAVE NO WAY OF DETERMINING IF THE OPERATOR WAS LICENSED; I CONSIDER IT A HIGH PROBABILITY THE INDIVIDUAL WAS A FRIEND WHO FLEW FOR HOBBY. A FACTOR IN MY ASSESSMENT OF THIS PROBABILITY IS THE HOPE THAT A LICENSED UAS OPERATOR WOULD KNOW BETTER THAN FLYING A UAS TWO MILES FROM A CLASS B AIRPORT OFF THE DEPARTURE END OF THE RUNWAY.,A R44 Pilot reported an encounter with a UAV just before liftoff.,2018,09
409,201809,NEW YORK,ON BOUNO4 ARRIVAL TRAVELING WESTBOUND ON TRACK BRIDGEPORT (BDR) TO ALIXX INTERSECTION; I SPOTTED A SMALL BLACK DRONE ROUGHLY 500 FT DIRECTLY ABOVE US ROUGHLY 2 MILES EAST OF ALIXX INTERSECTION. IT APPEARED TO MOVING SLOWLY EASTBOUND. I REPORTED IT TO THE NEW YORK TRACON. THEY NOTIFIED THE AIRCRAFT BEHIND US WHO WAS ALSO ON THE BOUNO4 ARRIVAL.,Gulfstream pilot reported; while on initial approach; sighting a drone 500 feet above the aircraft.,2018,09
410,201809,SOUTH DAKOTA,WHILE IN CRUISE PROFILE APPROXIMATELY 5NM N-NE OF FSD; CREW IDENTIFIED A BLUE & RED DRONE PASSING BY THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. AIRCRAFT RADAR ALTIMETER WAS INDICATING 1100 [AGL]. DRONE PASSED WITHIN [ESTIMATED] 200 FEET OF THE AIRCRAFT AT THE SAME ALTITUDE. NO PREVIOUS RECOGNITION OF THE DRONE AND NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS INITIATED.  EVENT REPORTED TO FSD TRACON AND SUBSEQUENT FOLLOWUP WITH FSD ATCT PERSONNEL. NO FURTHER INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO THE CREW.,Helicopter pilot reported a NMAC with drone.,2018,09
411,201810,CALIFORNIA,ON A VECTOR ON TRUKN2 [SID] JUST NORTH OF FIX COSMC PASSING 12;000 FT; I NOTICED TARGET OFF NOSE AND ABOUT A MILE; SMALL BUT BIG ENOUGH TO SPOT; OF UNUSUAL SHAPE. IT PASSED TO OUR RIGHT AT APPROXIMATELY 12;200 FT CO-ALTITUDE; 2-3;000 FEET LATERALLY. COPILOT HAD BETTER LOOK AND HAD HIGH CONFIDENCE IT WAS A DRONE DUE TO ODD FLAT SHAPE AND DISTINGUISHABLE PROTRUSIONS DOWNWARD. ATC NOTIFIED OF DETAILS. WE WERE ON A 040-DEGREE VECTOR NORTH OF SID; ESTIMATING 2-4 NM NORTH OF COSMC.,757 Captain reported the flight crew observed a UAV at their same altitude.,2018,10
412,201810,GEORGIA,FLYING SOUTH OF MIDCOAST REGIONAL AIRPORT; [I] SAW A DRONE BELIEVED MILITARY LESS THAN 1 MILE FROM MY HEADING; IT THEN TURNED NORTH AND WAS GONE. ON MY PART BETTER MONITORING OF MOA SPACE WAS NEEDED.,Light Sport pilot encountered a UAV near a MOA.,2018,10
413,201810,KANSAS,WE CHECKED IN TO KANSAS CITY CENTER AT FL280 ON AN ASSIGNED HEADING. CHECK IN WAS ACKNOWLEDGED AS USUAL BY THE CONTROLLER. OUR LAST ATC CLEARANCE WAS TO FLY A HEADING NEARLY 90 DEGREES OFF COURSE; AWAY FROM OUR DESTINATION; AND TO EXPECT MORE IN 4 MINUTES. AS NEARLY 5 MINUTES HAD PASSED; WE INQUIRED ABOUT OUR CLEARANCE FOR AN UPDATE AS TO WHEN WE COULD EXPECT TO TURN BACK ON COURSE. A VOICE SARCASTICALLY RESPONDED; AND REMINDED US 'WE WERE GOING TO A VERY BUSY AIRPORT.' AS THIS RESPONSE WAS SO SARCASTIC AND OF NO HELP WHATSOEVER; WE ASSUMED IT WAS ANYONE BUT AN AIR TRAFFIC CONTROLLER AND IGNORED IT; BELIEVING THE CONTROLLER AND WAS ALSO IGNORING THE SARCASTIC OUTBURST. A SHORT TIME LATER; WE WERE GIVEN FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. THE MALE VOICE ADDED; 'YOU CAN COME TO THE CENTER AND APPLY FOR JOBS.' WE COMPLIED WITH THE CLEARANCE AND THEN REALIZED WE HAD A CONTROLLER WORKING THE SECTOR AND ANOTHER ADDING (ON 2 OCCASIONS NOW) SARCASTIC; ANGRY COMMENTS. IT WAS ALL VERY CONFUSING. UPON HANDOFF TO CHICAGO BY THE CONTROLLER (PROFESSIONAL); WE REQUESTED THE INITIALS OF THE SARCASTIC INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS MAKING EVERYONE'S JOB THAT MUCH HARDER; ESPECIALLY THE JOB OF THE PROFESSIONAL CONTROLLER. WE GOT ANOTHER RANT ABOUT HOW UNPROFESSIONAL WE WERE AND AN INCOMPLETE PHONE NUMBER FROM THE STILL UNIDENTIFIED VOICE. WE CHANGED FREQUENCIES AND NORMAL ATC COMMUNICATIONS RESUMED. I HAVE NEVER HAD SUCH A CONFUSING EXCHANGE WITH ATC; NEVER NEEDED TO BE REMINDED I WAS FLYING INTO A BUSY AIRPORT; AND NEVER HAVE BEEN INVITED TO CENTER TO APPLY FOR A JOB FOR CLARIFYING A CLEARANCE/CLEARANCE LIMIT AND SEEKING INFORMATION FOR PLANNING PURPOSES. I HOPE NO ONE HAS A SIMILAR EXPERIENCE.,A319 Captain reported sarcastic unprofessional controller while in Kansas City airspace.,2018,10
414,201810,NEW JERSEY,AT 6;000 FEET NIGHT VMC. ABOUT 10NM SOUTH OF MORRISTOWN AIRPORT. I NOTICED A POSSIBLE DRONE ABOUT 500 TO 750 FEET ABOVE US MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION. IT WAS VERY FAST AND I JUST NOTICED THIS OFF THE CORNER OF MY LEFT PERIPHERAL VISION. THERE WAS NO TCAS IDENTIFICATION. WE REPORTED TO NY APPROACH A POSSIBLE DRONE SIGHTING.,Air Carrier Captain reported an airborne conflict with UAV during approach.,2018,10
415,201810,NEW JERSEY,ALL SOPS WERE FOLLOWED TO THE BEST OF MY ABILITY AND KNOWLEDGE. JUST WEST OF TEB ON A HEADING; SPEED; ALTITUDE OF 5;000 [FEET]; APPROACH ISSUED A CLEARANCE OF SPEED 180 THEN DESCEND TO 3;000 [FEET]. THE AIRCRAFT WAS ON AUTOPILOT B. MCP SPEED 180 FLAPS TO 5; SPEED 195 AND SLOWING. I CALLED FOR FLAPS 10 AND LEVEL CHANGE; [EXTENDED THE] SPEED BRAKE AND AS AIRCRAFT STARTED DESCENT; ATC [ASSIGNED] SPEED 180 THEN DESCEND. THE AIRCRAFT WAS 185 TO 180 WHEN CALL ANSWERED. CLEARANCE OF A HEADING TO INTERCEPT 22L AND SPEED 170. ATC WAS VERY BUSY AND NO APPROACH CLEARANCE WAS RECEIVED AS WE FLEW PAST THE FAF. THE CAPTAIN STATED FOR ME TO 'START DOWN'. I STATED WE DID NOT RECEIVE APPROACH CLEARANCE. CAPTAIN SWITCHED TO TOWER AND ASKED IF WE WERE CLEARED TO LAND. TOWER GAVE US CLEARANCE TO LAND; BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY BUT LOGICAL TRANSFER OF TOWER GIVING US THE CLEARANCE TO LAND; I FOLLOWED THE CAPTAIN'S DEMANDS. I UNCOUPLED THE AUTOPILOT; REQUESTED GEAR DOWN; FLAPS 15; THEN 25 AS I APPROACHED 1;500 [FEET]; SLOWING AIRCRAFT ON FLAPS SCHEDULE WHILE ASSESSING THE TRAFFIC AHEAD. FLAPS 30; [ON] TARGET; ON PATH AND SPEED AT 1;300 FEET. BECAUSE OF THE UNCERTAINTY I AGAIN REQUESTED A RESPONSE [FROM] THE CAPTAIN FOR LANDING CLEARANCE ON SHORT FINAL. TO MAKE THE 35 [FEET] OVER THE RWY I STATED TO THE CAPTAIN I WOULD BRING THE AIRCRAFT TO THREE PINK OVER THE END. THE PRECEDING AIRCRAFT WAKE TURBULENCE WAS EVIDENT BUT MINIMAL. I WAS STRAIGHT DOWN THE RUNWAY CENTERLINE; WITH 1 TO 4 DEGREES OF LEFT; THEN RIGHT AILERON ETC; (NO RUDDER) TO COMPENSATE [FOR] THE WAKE. THE AIRCRAFT STARTED TO BALLOON ONCE AND WAS IMMEDIATELY SMOOTHLY ARRESTED ON PROFILE. FOR NO APPARENT REASON; AT APPROXIMATELY 20 FEET THE CAPTAIN ABRUPTLY CALLED 'I HAVE THE AIRCRAFT' AND COMMANDEERED THE PLANE. I IMMEDIATELY TOOK MY LEFT HAND OFF THE THROTTLES BUT NEVER SAW THE CAPTAIN COVER THE THROTTLES UNTIL HE HIT THE PAVEMENT. HIS COMMAND OF THE AIRCRAFT WAS NO DIFFERENT IN AILERON CONTROL. WHILE BRAKING THE CAPTAIN STATED HOLD SHORT OF 22R. I DID NOT HEAR ANY TRANSMISSION FROM TOWER UNTIL WE WERE ALREADY HOLDING AT 22R AND ACKNOWLEDGED TO HOLD AT 22R FOR THE NEXT TWO AIRCRAFT.,B737NG First Officer reported the Captain took control of the aircraft on short final for unknown reasons.,2018,10
416,201810,NEW YORK,FLIGHT CONDUCTED VFR GPS DIRECT TO [DESTINATION] WITH VFR ADVISORIES ALONG ENTIRE ROUTE. DRONE SIGHTED ON RIGHT SIDE SIDE OF AIRCRAFT AT DESIGNATED LOCATION AND SEEN BY BOTH PASSENGER AND PILOT. DRONE WAS A BLACK QUADCOPTER. SIGHTING REPORTED TO NY APPROACH. FLIGHT CONDITION WAS VFR ON TOP ABOVE A SOLID OVERCAST AT 3500 FT.,Cessna 182 pilot reported airborne conflict with UAV.,2018,10
417,201810,NEW YORK,ON APPROACH IN JFK FOR ILS 22R (MAY HAVE BEEN 22L); JUST PAST THE OUTER MARKER (PROBABLY MATTR) I SAW SOMETHING SMALL THAT DIDN'T APPEAR TO BE MOVING UP AHEAD IN THE WINDSCREEN. WE WERE DESCENDING ON THE GLIDESLOPE. ONCE I DETERMINED THE OBJECT APPEARED MOSTLY STATIONARY; WHILE STAYING AT THE SAME ALTITUDE; I DIDN'T FEEL THAT A COURSE CHANGE OR ATTITUDE CHANGE WAS NECESSARY. I ALSO ONLY HAD SEVERAL SECONDS TO IDENTIFY THE OBJECT; DETERMINE ITS SIZE; AND EVEN CONSIDER EVASIVE ACTION. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A SMALL; QUAD-COPTER DRONE. IT WAS GREY IN COLOR WITH THE RECTANGULAR BODY THAT SEEMS UBIQUITOUS TO MANY DESIGNS. IT APPEARED TO FLY 100 TO 200 FEET ABOVE OUR ALTITUDE OF 1600 FEET MSL. WE WERE ON ABOUT A 4-MILE FINAL. I DON'T THINK THE FIRST OFFICER (PILOT MONITORING) EVER SAW IT. WE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED IT TO ATC. WE GAVE JFK GROUND A MORE EXACT DESCRIPTION THAN TOWER RECEIVED. IF I HAD BEEN SCANNING THE FLIGHT INSTRUMENTS RATHER THAN LOOKING OUTSIDE; THEN I MAY HAVE NEVER SEEN THE DRONE. THERE WAS NOTHING WE COULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY. PERHAPS DRONE SIGHTINGS AND SUGGESTED PROCEDURES COULD BE MENTIONED IN ONE OF THE MANUALS.,Air Carrier Captain reported a NMAC with a Drone on a four mile final to JFK.,2018,10
418,201810,NEW YORK,DURING CLIMB OUT PASSING APPROXIMATELY 25;000 FEET WE ENCOUNTERED A BRIEF MOMENT OF SEVERE TURBULENCE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 25;000-26;000 FEET. POSSIBLY WAKE TURBULENCE FROM ANOTHER AIRCRAFT. THE TURBULENCE STARTED AND ENDED AFTER 2-3 SECONDS. THERE WAS NO TIME TO COMMAND 'FLIGHT ATTENDANTS BE SEATED IMMEDIATELY' AS THE EVENT WAS OVER BEFORE I COULD EVEN PICK UP THE CABIN INTERPHONE. WE CHECKED IN WITH THE CABIN AND INITIALLY WERE TOLD ONE OF THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS IN THE AFT GALLEY HAD SUSTAINED A WRIST INJURY. THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS IN THE MID AND AFT GALLEYS ALSO INDICATED A LOUD BANG WAS HEARD AND THAT THE TAIL SHOOK VIOLENTLY WITH THE TURBULENCE ENCOUNTER. WE CONTINUED THE CLIMB TO 31;000 FEET. AT LEVEL OFF WE EVALUATED THE EICAS; STAT; F/CTRL AND GEAR PAGES ON THE MFDS. NOTHING ABNORMAL WAS NOTED. ADDITIONALLY; WE COULD NOT MAKE CONTACT WITH NEW YORK OCEANIC ON THE L HF RADIO. UPON SUCCESSFUL CONTACT WITH NEW YORK OCEANIC ON THE R HF RADIO WE COULD NOT RECEIVE A SUCCESSFUL SELCAL CHECK ON EITHER RADIO. WE CONTACTED DISPATCH VIA SATCOM AND CONDUCTED A CONFERENCE CALL WITH [MAINTENANCE] AND THE [CHIEF PILOT]. WE CAME TO A COLLABORATIVE DECISION AFTER DESCRIBING THE INCIDENT THAT IN THE INTEREST OF SAFETY WE SHOULD AIR RETURN TO [DEPARTURE AIRPORT] TO HAVE THE AIRCRAFT INSPECTED. I CALLED BACK TO HAVE THE RELIEF PILOT WOKEN UP. HE RETURNED TO THE COCKPIT AND BEFORE MAKING THE FINAL CALL TO TURN AROUND WE CONSULTED ONE LAST TIME WITH ALL THREE OF US ON THE FLIGHT DECK. HE AGREED WITH ALL OF THE ABOVE. WE RECEIVED A CLEARANCE FROM NEW YORK OCEANIC AND INITIATED THE RETURN TO [DEPARTURE AIRPORT]. WE COORDINATED WITH DISPATCH AND NEW YORK OCEANIC TO DUMP THE REMAINING FUEL IN OUR CENTER TANK TO BE UNDER MAX LANDING WEIGHT. DURING THE DESCENT WE EXPERIENCE A PARTIAL FAILURE OF THE L AUTOPILOT. WE LOST PITCH MODE OF THE L AUTOPILOT AND SWITCHED TO THE R AUTOPILOT WITHOUT FURTHER ISSUE. ON DOWNWIND APPROACH AT 4000 FEET WE STRUCK A BIRD WITH THE RADOME. CONFIGURATION AND APPROACH WAS NORMAL. TOUCHDOWN WAS NORMAL. NO OTHER ANOMALIES WERE FELT DURING THE APPROACH AND LANDING.,B767 flight crew reported returning to departure airport after experiencing multiple system anomalies following a severe wake turbulence encounter climbing through FL250.,2018,10
419,201811,CALIFORNIA,WE WERE ABEAM VNY AT 5000 MSL FOR RUNWAY 16R. THEY ASKED IF WE WANTED THE VISUAL AND WE TOLD THEM NO; THAT WE WANTED VECTORS TO FINAL. I DIDN'T WANT TO TRY AND STAY WITHIN THE MOUNTAINS TO THE SOUTH WHILE TRYING TO LOSE THAT MUCH ALTITUDE. THEY VECTORED US TO FINAL AND NOTHING WAS UNUSUAL. ABOUT JINAT; WE STARTED GETTING SOME TURBULENCE BUT; NOTHING UNUSUAL WITH THE MOUNTAINS THERE. ESTABLISHED INBOUND NEAR FURRY WE NOTICED WE HAD A 47KT TAILWIND. WE CONTINUED AND ASKED FOR A WIND CHECK. AT THAT POINT- MAYBE 2000 WE HAD 27KT OF TAILWIND. THE TOWER SAID THEY WERE CALM. WE DISCUSSED THINGS AS NONE OF THIS WAS FORECAST AND IT WAS CLEAR. WE THEN GOT A WIND SHEAR CAUTION. AS QUICK AS WE GOT THAT WE STARTED TO BALLOON FROM THE INCREASE IN PERFORMANCE AND WENT WHITE OVER WHITE ON THE PAPI. WE DID A GO AROUND.WE HAD BRIEFED ALL THE TERRAIN AND THE MSA IN ALL QUADRANTS. WE HAD ALSO BRIEFED THE 1750' HOLD DOWN ON THE MISSED. WHEN WE STARTED TO GO MISSED TOWER ISSUED A CLIMB TO 4000' AND RUNWAY HEADING. AT ABOUT 1500' THEY SAID TO STOP THE CLIMB AT 2000' AND THEY WOULD BRING US BACK FOR 34. SAID TO TURN RIGHT FOR THE VISUAL. AT THIS POINT WE WERE IN THE HILLS ON THE SOUTH END AND 2000 WAS NOT GOING TO KEEP US CLEAR. WE COULD NOT GET A REVISED CLEARANCE IN TIME AND CLIMBED ON OUR OWN TO AVOID TERRAIN. WE MANEUVERED TO GET BACK FOR A LANDING ON 34L.IT WAS A TOTAL FIASCO AND REALLY RATTLED ME. I THINK IT RATTLED ATC TOO AS THEY WERE TREATING US LIKE A SMALL CESSNA THEY COULD KEEP IN CLOSE. WE NEVER GOT A TERRAIN WARNING BUT DID GET A CAUTION AT ONE POINT AND CLIMBED UP MORE. CLEAR SKY; NO CLOUDS AND CALM WINDS ON THE GROUND. NOBODY EXPECTED THIS AND TOWER SHOULD HAVE KEPT US ON THE PUBLISHED MISSED AND TURNED US OVER TO APPROACH TO GET VECTORS BACK. WE STAYED CLEAR OF THE TERRAIN ON OUR OWN BUT; HONESTLY; I DON'T KNOW ABOUT AIRSPACE CLEARANCE. THIS REALLY RATTLED MY CAGE. BY THE TIME WE TOOK BACK OFF THE WINDS WERE 340 GUSTING TO 25.,Business jet First Officer reported a windshear missed approach in VNY led to a terrain warning when ATC did not utilize the published missed approach procedure.,2018,11
420,201811,CALIFORNIA,A LARGE DRONE (APPROXIMATELY 2 FEET HIGH) PASSED THE RIGHT WING DURING APPROACH TO LAX AT GLIDESLOPE INTERCEPT. DISTANCE ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT 100 METERS. REPORTED TO ATC.,Air Carrier flight crew reported an NMAC with a drone while on final approach to LAX.,2018,11
421,201811,CALIFORNIA,ON APPROACH TO SAN WE SAW WHAT APPEARED TO BE A DRONE OR UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT CROSSING OUR FLIGHT PATH. WE CALLED IT AND WERE ASKED WHAT ALTITUDE. WE REPLIED POSSIBLY 5000 FEET OR 6000 FEET MSL. WE WERE ISSUED TO FLY LOC 27 OR RNAV 27 AFTER LUCKI ARRIVAL AND KEEP THE SPEED UP. WE CLOSED THE LOOP AND REMARKED ABOUT THE [WEATHER] SOUTH OF THE BORDER AND WERE BOTH CURIOUS WHAT A LARGE DRONE WOULD HAVE BEEN DOING. ABOUT 5000 FEET ON ARRIVAL; WE WERE QUESTIONED AS TO OUR TRACK AND ASKED IF WE HAD THE FIELD IN SIGHT. WE REPLIED YES AND AFTER LANDING WERE ASKED TO CONTACT ATC.,Air Carrier Captain reported a drone sighting while established on arrival to SAN.,2018,11
422,201811,CALIFORNIA,WHILE ON LUCKI 4 ARRIVAL TO SAN; WE WERE DISTRACTED BY AN ODD AIRCRAFT CLOSE TO OUR TRACK. IT LOOKED LIKE A LARGE DRONE. WE WERE DISTRACTED DISCUSSING THIS AIRCRAFT AND POSSIBLY MISSED SOMETHING. SOON AFTER ATC MADE AN ODD QUERY AS TO OUR POSITION AS IF WE WERE TRACKING INCORRECTLY; ASKED IF WE HAD THE FIELD IN SIGHT. I REPLIED THAT WE DID AND ATC CLEARED US FOR A VISUAL APPROACH. AFTER LANDING THEY GAVE A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL FOR POSSIBLE DEVIATION. SOCAL IMPLIED WE WERE OFF COURSE/ASKED IF FIELD IN SIGHT/CLEARED US FOR A VISUAL APPROACH. I AM UNSURE WHAT WAS WRONG. NEED BETTER COMMUNICATION WITH ATC.,First Officer reported sighting a drone while on initial approach to SAN; which caused a distraction and possible track deviation.,2018,11
423,201811,COLORADO,A DRONE PASSED US ABOUT 500-700 FEET BELOW US AND ABOUT 1000 FEET TO THE AIRCRAFT'S RIGHT AS WE WERE DOING A VISUAL APPROACH.,Air carrier flight crew reported a conflict with a Drone on approach to DEN.,2018,11
424,201811,FLORIDA,GO-AROUND FROM POSSIBLE WAKE TURBULENCE OR PERHAPS UNDER ESTIMATED CROSS WIND OR EVEN PERHAPS A TAIL WIND.ARRIVAL INTO MIA LANDING WITH REPORTED DIRECT CROSSWIND WIND WITHIN LIMITS; AND [DEPARTING HEAVY]; HOLDING FOR TAKEOFF. [HEAVY AIRCRAFT] BEGAN ROLLING AS WE DESCENDED THROUGH 1;000 FEET. GUSTY CONDITIONS. STABLE AT 500 FEET ON VISUAL. STABLE IN FLARE; AND FLOATED; [THEN] BALLOONED INTO AN UNSAFE LANDING CONDITION. EXECUTED GO-AROUND PROCEDURE. CAME AROUND AGAIN; SAME CONDITIONS BUT MORE MANAGEABLE; FLOATED IN FLARE; SIDE SLIPPED ON TOUCHDOWN.MORE SEPARATION BETWEEN DEPARTING [HEAVIES]. DON'T HAVE PLANES LANDING AT OR BEYOND POSSIBLE CROSSWIND LIMITATIONS. CLARIFY WHERE THE WIND READOUT IS FROM  MID FIELD ETC.,Airbus Captain reported executing a go-around at MIA after encountering jet blast from a departing Heavy aircraft.,2018,11
425,201811,ILLINOIS,AFTER LANDING ON 27L AT ORD; CLEARED THE RUNWAY AT A1 AND JOINED BRAVO. THE UNSPOKEN RULE IN ORD IS 'DON'T STOP MOVING' UNLESS GROUND TELLS YOU TO. I PROCEEDED DOWN B EXPECTING TO BE CLEARED TO [THE] GATE OR TO THE HOLDING BLOCK IF NOT AVAILABLE. GROUND CONTROL WAS CONGESTED AND I WAS APPROACHING A3 WITH NO CONTACT YET. AN AIRBUS WAS HOLDING SHORT OF B ON THE WEST SIDE OF B; SLIGHTLY BEYOND THE HOLD BARS; AS HE WAS PROBABLY TOLD TO HOLD SHORT OF B WITH LATE NOTICE.(THIS WILL HAPPEN OFTEN WHEN AN AIRCRAFT CLEARS AT A1 SUCH AS WE DID). PROCEEDING PAST THE AIRBUS REQUIRED ME TO PROCEED VERY SLOWLY TO INSURE WINGTIP CLEARANCE WITH HIS NOSE. AT THIS POINT ORD GROUND FINALLY MADE CONTACT (WITH A QUIP ABOUT ME PLOWING RIGHT THROUGH); ASKED OUR GATE; AND CLEARED US TO [THAT GATE]. GROUND DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH MY ACTIONS. RIGHT AFTER WE ACKNOWLEDGED INSTRUCTIONS TO THE GATE; AN UNIDENTIFIED COMMENT CAME ACROSS 'HE NEARLY CLIPPED US'. I HAVE TO ASSUME THIS WAS [THE] AIRBUS REFERRING TO MY PASSING. WE PROCEEDED PAST [THE] AIRBUS WITH COMPLETE CAUTION AND HAD NO DOUBT WE WERE CLEAR OF HIS AIRCRAFT AS WE PASSED. THIS EVENT ONLY CAUSED ME CONCERN DUE TO THE COMMENT BY [THE] AIRBUS. I DO NOT BELIEVE I DEVIATED FROM 'NORMAL' ORD PROCEDURES AND DID NOT RECEIVE ANY FEEDBACK FROM ORD GROUND.,B737 flight crew reported that; while taxiing to the gate at ORD; the pilot of another aircraft  expressed concern about the perceived insufficient separation.,2018,11
426,201811,MASSACHUSETTS,ON ARRIVAL INTO BOS; ON WHAT WAS EFFECTIVELY BASE LEG PRIOR TO TURNING FINAL FOR RUNWAY 22L; JUST AS WE WERE BEGINNING A DESCENT OUT OF 3000 FEET; I SAW A BLUE AND WHITE UAV PASS DIRECTLY UNDER THE NOSE OF THE AIRCRAFT. I WOULD ESTIMATE THE DISTANCE BELOW US TO HAVE BEEN 300 FEET. THE ENCOUNTER LASTED LESS THAN 2-3 SECONDS FROM INITIAL SIGHTING TO THE UAV PASSING OUT OF SIGHT BENEATH OUR AIRCRAFT. BLUE AND WHITE AND 4-ROTOR; I THINK; THOUGH I ONLY CAUGHT THE BRIEF GLIMPSE OF IT. NO ACTION WAS TAKEN ON OUR PART AS THE DEVICE WAS GONE BEFORE WE COULD DO ANYTHING. I NOTIFIED ATC OF THE ENCOUNTER. I TRANSFERRED CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT BRIEFLY TO THE FIRST OFFICER SO I COULD CONCENTRATE ON THE COMMUNICATION AS ANY DANGER WAS PAST. THE FIRST OFFICER HAD BEEN 'HEADS DOWN' FOR THAT BRIEF MOMENT 'SEQUENCING THE APPROACH'; SO SHE NEVER SAW ANYTHING. HER FIRST KNOWLEDGE OF THE EVENT WAS WHEN I STARTED TALKING TO ATC. THE CONTROLLER ASKED THE USUAL QUESTIONS; AND THEN CLEARED US FOR THE APPROACH. NORMAL APPROACH AND LANDING. TAXIED TO THE GATE. NO FURTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN. NEITHER THE FIRST OFFICER NOR I HAD ANY CONTACT WITH ANYONE OTHER THAN COMPANY PEOPLE ABOUT THE INCIDENT. AN IDIOT WITH A DRONE. NOTHING WE COULD HAVE DONE. NO WAY FOR THE ATC PEOPLE TO KNOW ABOUT IT. BAN ALL DRONE USE WITHIN 50 MILES OF ANY AIRPORT. ARREST AND JAIL ANYONE CAUGHT VIOLATING THIS RULE.,Air carrier Captain reported airborne conflict with a UAV on base leg into BOS.,2018,11
427,201811,WASHINGTON,ON FINAL FOR THE VISUAL 34L INTO SEA WE WERE FOLLOWING A [WIDEBODY] BEING VECTORED FOR THE APPROACH TO 34C. BEING 5 MILES BEHIND THE HEAVY JET; WE WERE CLEARED FOR THE VISUAL AND I EVEN PRUDENTLY ASKED FOR THE SEPARATION AND THEIR SPEED TO BETTER ADJUST THINGS ON OUR END TO AVOID WAKE TURBULENCE. AROUND 5-10 MILES FROM THE RUNWAY AT APPROXIMATELY 2500-3000 FT; WE EXPERIENCED A ROLL UPSET FROM WAKE TURBULENCE FROM THE [WIDEBODY]. IT WAS AGGRESSIVE; BUT CONTROLLABLE. IF I HAD TO GUESS; THE AIRCRAFT WAS QUICKLY ROLLED TO ABOUT A 20 DEGREE BANK. THE EVENT ONLY LASTED A COUPLE OF SECONDS BEFORE WE CORRECTED THE UPSET AND WERE EASILY RE-ESTABLISHED. THE CAPTAIN ADJUSTED THE GLIDE PATH TO SIT EVEN HIGHER TO THE GLIDE SLOPE AS TO AVOID THE WAKE TURBULENCE; BUT WITHIN THE STABLE CRITERIA. THE REST OF THE APPROACH AND LANDING WAS UNEVENTFUL AND THE LANDING AND TAXI TO THE GATE ROUTINE. UPON REACHING THE GATE AND DEPLANING; ONE PASSENGER STATED 'THANKS FOR NOT KILLING US' IN A VERY RUDE DISDAINFUL TONE. THE SECOND PASSENGER ASKED IF WE DODGED AN AIRPLANE OR BIRDS. NEITHER WERE TRUE. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THE PASSENGER CONCERNS; I FOUND IT NECESSARY TO FILE AN ASAP AND CREW REPORT. AFTER THAT THE FLIGHT ATTENDANT-A INFORMED US THAT THE PASSENGER DIDN'T WEAR HIS SEAT BELT EVEN WHEN INSTRUCTED TO. HE WAS ALSO THE INDIVIDUAL THAT STATED HIS REMARKS TO US. I ALSO THINK THAT THE [WIDEBODY] WAS HIGH ON HIS VISUAL APPROACH TO 34C SO IT PUT THE WAKE TURBULENCE RIGHT AT OUR ALTITUDE WHEN WE WERE FLYING A HIGHER GLIDE SLOPE ALREADY; BUT IT WAS DARK AND DIFFICULT TO SEE THE SITUATION FULLY. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE WAKE SEPARATION BE INCREASED FOR [WIDEBODIES]. FIVE MILES WAS JUST BARELY ADEQUATE AND ANY AIRCRAFT SMALLER MIGHT ACTUALLY EXPERIENCE JET UPSET AT A LOW ALTITUDE.,EMB-175 reported encountering wake turbulence on approach to SEA in trail of a widebody transport. Reporter recommended increased separation from this type aircraft.,2018,11
428,201812,FLORIDA,WE ENCOUNTERED A DRONE AT OUR CRUISE ALTITUDE OF 4500 FEET. IT WAS CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE AS AN UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE WITH A WHITE/RED TOP AND BLACK BOTTOM. NO EVASIVE ACTION TAKEN BECAUSE THE TIME BETWEEN SEEING THE DRONE AND THE DRONE PASSING ABOUT 150 FEET FROM OUR LEFT WING WAS TOO SHORT (ESTIMATE BETWEEN 0.5 AND 1 SECOND).,C-172 pilot reported sighting a drone close by during cruise flight.,2018,12
429,201812,MISSOURI,AT 1000 FEET ON APPROACH INTO MCI; WE WERE JUST COMING OUT OF A THIN LAYER OF CLOUDS WHEN WE STRUCK WHAT APPEARED TO BE MULTIPLE BIRDS. WE HEARD A LOUD BANG ON THE NOSE OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE ENGINES APPEARED TO BE UNAFFECTED; HOWEVER; WE DID NOTE A STRONG SMELL WHICH INDICATED A BIRD(S) HAD BEEN INGESTED BY AN ENGINE. AFTER LANDING; I CONTACTED DISPATCH AND MAINTENANCE. THE AIRCRAFT WAS TAKEN OUT OF SERVICE.,B737-700 Captain reported a bird strike on approach to MCI resulted in the aircraft being taken out of service.,2018,12
430,201812,NEBRASKA,APPROACHED PLATTSMOUTH AIRPORT (PMV) FROM THE WEST AT 2;200 MSL WITH INTENTION TO PRACTICE LANDINGS WITH STUDENT. AWOS REPORTED WIND DIRECTION FROM 240; WHICH SLIGHTLY FAVORED RUNWAY 16. ANNOUNCED ON CTAF (122.7) INTENTION TO ENTER LEFT DOWNWIND TO RUNWAY 16 BY CROSSING RUNWAY AT MIDFIELD. AN UNIDENTIFIED VOICE CAME OVER CTAF STATING 'ACTIVE RUNWAY IS 34.' I REPLIED ON CTAF 'WINDS FAVOR 16.' I THEN SAW AIRCRAFT Y HOLDING AT THE APPROACH END OF RUNWAY 34. I ANNOUNCED ON CTAF WE WOULD SWITCH TO RUNWAY 34. I INSTRUCTED MY STUDENT TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE AIRPORT AND CLIMB TO 2;700. WE TURNED SOUTH APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE EAST OF THE RUNWAY AND TURNED SOUTH. WE TURNED BACK TO THE WEST AND PASSED ONE MILE SOUTH OF THE AIRPORT. WE THEN HEARD THE AIRCRAFT Y PILOT REPORT 'AIRCRAFT Y...DEPARTING THE PATTERN TO THE SOUTH.' I IMMEDIATELY ANNOUNCED MY POSITION 'AIRCRAFT X...SOUTH OF PLATTSMOUTH AT 2;700 FEET.' ABOUT 12 SECONDS LATER I SPOTTED AIRCRAFT Y BELOW OUR ALTITUDE ON AN INTERSECTING COURSE. AT THE SAME TIME AIRCRAFT Y PILOT CAME ON THE RADIO AND SAID 'AIRCRAFT X AT PLATTSMOUTH; I'LL FLY UNDER YOU.' I REPLIED; 'I SEE YOU; AIRCRAFT Y; HAVE A GOOD FLIGHT.' HE PASSED UNDER AND SLIGHTLY BEHIND US. TO PREVENT A RECURRENCE I WOULD QUERY THE DEPARTING AIRCRAFT AS TO DIRECTION OF FLIGHT AND PLAN PATTERN ENTRY ACCORDINGLY. HAD AIRCRAFT Y BEEN SHOWING A LANDING LIGHT; I WOULD HAVE SEEN HIM MUCH SOONER. A CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THIS OCCURRENCE WAS THE WIND DIRECTION BEING NEARLY PERPENDICULAR TO THE RUNWAY; MAKING RUNWAY SELECTION SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS.,GA instructor reported an NMAC near PMV.,2018,12
431,201812,NORTH CAROLINA,I CONDUCTED A RECREATIONAL SIGHTSEEING FLIGHT OVER JORDAN LAKE. DURING THIS FLIGHT I NOTED THAT THE PRESENCE OF WATERFOWL AND OTHER BIRDS HAD INCREASED IN THE AREA. PRIOR TO AND AGAIN DURING THE FLIGHT I NOTED THAT NO WILDLIFE/WATERFOWL PRESERVATION ZONES WERE NOTED IN THIS AREA. DUE TO WHAT MAY BE A SEASONAL OR MIGRATION CHANGE IN THE WILDLIFE POPULATION; A NOTATION ON THE SECTIONAL CHARTS OR A NOTAM MAY BE BENEFICIAL TO BOTH THE OTHER PILOTS AND THE MIGRATING WILDLIFE.,Small aircraft pilot reported that after flying over the aforementioned area; a NOTAM and / or chart notation regarding the bird migration should be issued.,2018,12
432,201812,TEXAS,THIS IS ACTUALLY 2 DIFFERENT INCIDENTS THAT HAPPENED WITHIN LESS THAN 15 MINUTES OF EACH OTHER. 1.) LOCAL CONTROL (LC) REQUESTED TO RIGHT TURN OFF RUNWAY 26L. I TOLD THE CONTROLLER HEADING HIS CHOICE RELEASED. SEVERAL MINUTES LATER; THE SECOND AIRCRAFT DEPARTS AIRCRAFT X ON A RIGHT TURN DIRECT CADEK (A FIX ON THE TDOWN3 SID). THE HEADING TURNED AIRCRAFT X RIGHT INTO A VFR TARGET; INDICATING 095 THAT WAS OVERFLYING THE AIRPORT AND WAS NOT ON FREQUENCY. AFTER REVIEWING THE TAPES; THE LC CONTROLLER GAVE AIRCRAFT X A TRAFFIC CALLED AND SAID CONTACT DEPARTURE. AS SOON AS AIRCRAFT X CHECKED ON; I IMMEDIATELY TURNED HIM TO A 360 HEADING TO AVOID THAT TRAFFIC THAT WAS NOT ON FREQUENCY. IF AIRCRAFT X HAD GOTTEN LOST IN FREQUENCY LAND OR TOOK TOO LONG TO CHECK IN; AIRCRAFT X WOULD HAVE CLIMBED RIGHT INTO THE UNIDENTIFIED VFR TARGET.2.) AIRCRAFT Y CHECKED ON WITH ME IN DEPARTURE. ON HIS FLIGHT STRIP; THE LC CONTROLLER HAD WRITTEN 'TURN LEFT 120.' I SAID RADAR CONTACT AND NOTHING ELSE. I NEEDED AIRCRAFT Y TO CLIMB ON THE 120 HEADING FOR TRAFFIC. AIRCRAFT Y COMES BACK AND ASKS IF I WANT HIM ON A HEADING; THAT HE WAS NEVER ASSIGNED ONE. I TURN HIM LEFT 120. AFTER REVIEWING THE TAPES; THE LC CONTROLLER NEVER ISSUED AIRCRAFT Y A HEADING. THE AIRCRAFT WAS ONLY CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF. AIRCRAFT Y WAS ON RUNWAY HEADING; FLYING DIRECTLY AT A MOUNTAIN. AIRCRAFT Y WAS CLIMBING OUT OF APPROXIMATELY 052 IN A 080 MVA WHEN I TURNED THE AIRCRAFT.,ELP TRACON Controller reported two incidents where the Tower Controller issued unsafe headings.,2018,12
433,201901,CALIFORNIA,AIRCRAFT X WAS A SCHEDULED ALTRV [ALTITUDE RESERVATION] SCHEDULED WITH THE MOS [MILITARY OPERATIONS SPECIALIST]. AIRSPACE WAS NOT SCHEDULED IN THE EDST [EN-ROUTE DECISION SUPPORT TOOL] AND THE CONTROLLER MISSED THE ALTRV. THE AIRCRAFT WAS A DRONE WITH HIS TRANSPONDER OFF. THIS WAS COORDINATED WITH THE MOS AND PAPERWORK WAS DISTRIBUTED TO THE AREAS. AIRSPACE SHOULD HAVE BEEN SCHEDULED IN THE EDST AND CONTROLLERS AND THE FLM [FRONT LINE MANAGER] SHOULD BE VERBALLY BRIEFED.,ZLA Front Line Manager reported a UAV was scheduled into an Altitude Reservation but knowledge of it was not posted nor were the Controllers informed.,2019,01
434,201901,CALIFORNIA,I WAS WORKING LICKE/HOOKS COMBINED ON MY LAST RADAR SESSION. AIRCRAFT X CHECKED IN DESCENDING VIA THE SILICON ARRIVAL INTO SJC; AND I CLEARED THE AIRCRAFT FOR THE APPROACH AFTER AN INITIAL SCAN OF THE ARRIVAL CORRIDOR INDICATING NO CONFLICTING VFR TARGETS. IT HAD BEEN AN EXTREMELY BUSY DAY FOR ME ON THESE SECTORS WITH NUMEROUS UNIDENTIFIED TARGETS IN THE SOUTH BAY AREA; SO I HAD BEEN VERY VIGILANT IN MISSING NUMEROUS TARGETS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. WHEN I CLEARED AIRCRAFT X; THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC I SAW TO BE A FACTOR. AT THE SAME TIME; I WAS VECTORING A B737 TO FINAL FOR A VISUAL APPROACH TO AVOID A C172 THAT I WAS VECTORING ACROSS THE SJC FINALS FOR A GPS APPROACH AT PAO; AND I WAS VECTORING A GULFSTREAM FROM OSI AREA NORTH OF HIS NORMAL ARRIVAL ROUTE AT 5000 FT. TO MISS AN UNIDENTIFIED TARGET AT 4600 FT; WHICH I MISSED WITH VECTORS BY 2 MILES. AS I WAS WATCHING THIS SITUATION; AIRCRAFT X KEYED UP AND SAID 'APPROACH AIRCRAFT X'; TO WHICH I REPLIED 'GO AHEAD'; AND AS THE COLLISION ALERT ON MY SCOPE WAS GOING OFF HE INDICATED A TCAS RA (RESOLUTION ADVISORY) (WHICH BLOCKED THE FREQUENCY FROM ME CALLING THE TRAFFIC); AND THIS WAS THE FIRST TIME I OBSERVED THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGET AT SOMEWHERE AROUND 9500 FT. BENEATH HIM AS AIRCRAFT X CLIMBED OUT OF 9800 TO 10300 FT; AND THE AIRCRAFT CROSSED. I SAID ROGER AND INFORMED AIRCRAFT X OF THE ALERT AS WELL. I FAILED TO GIVE A TRAFFIC ALERT AS AIRCRAFT X WAS ALREADY IN THE CLIMB AND I OBSERVED THEY WERE PASSING. I FELT COMPLETELY HELPLESS AND IN SHOCK AT THE EVENT BECAUSE I NEVER SAW THE TARGET COMING AT AIRCRAFT X. I ADVISED AIRCRAFT X TO ADVISE WHEN FINISHED AND DESCENDED THE AIRCRAFT TO 6000 FT; AND HE WAS CLEARED FOR AN ILS APPROACH TO SJC; LANDING WITHOUT INCIDENT. I QUERIED THE PILOT ABOUT THE AIRCRAFT AND HE SAID HE SAW WHAT HE BELIEVED TO BE AIRCRAFT Y. AIRCRAFT Y LATER CALLED THE ARRIVAL SECTOR THAT AIRCRAFT X WAS IN WHEN THE CONFLICT HAPPENED AND SAID HE HAD DEPARTED WATSONVILLE (WVI); AN AIRPORT ABOUT 5-10 MILES WEST OF AIRCRAFT X'S STAR; AND AN UNCONTROLLED FIELD. I HAVE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE FALCON REPLAY OF THE EVENT BUT PLAN TO DO SO THE FIRST DAY I AM BACK NEXT WEEK. MY ASSUMPTION AT THIS POINT IS HE CLIMBED RAPIDLY AND I SIMPLY MISSED IT AS I WAS WORKING TO MISS OTHER AIRCRAFT WITH VECTORS ABOUT 25 MILES NORTH OF WHERE THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED. I PRIDE MYSELF ON CATCHING THINGS OUT OF THE ORDINARY AND MY SCAN HAS PROTECTED NUMEROUS AIRCRAFT FROM UNIDENTIFIED TARGETS AND CONTROLLED AIRCRAFT REGULARLY; ESPECIALLY TODAY WITH AN EXORBITANT NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT JUST OUTSIDE THE CLASS CHARLIE NOT TALKING TO CONTROLLERS; AND I AM IN UTTER SHOCK THAT I DID NOT SEE THIS ONE UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE. THERE IS A SLIGHT POSSIBILITY THAT BECAUSE I HAVE ONLY BEEN WORKING ONE SECTOR COMBINATION CONTINUOUSLY AND IT WAS A VERY BUSY DAY; I COULD HAVE BEEN FATIGUED FROM THE CONTINUOUS SCAN FOR UNIDENTIFIED TARGETS WHICH I HAD BEEN MISSING ALL DAY. BREAKS WERE LESS FREQUENT AS A RESULT OF STAFFING BEING BELOW NUMBERS FOR THE DAY; DUE TO REDUCED STAFFING DURING THE SHUTDOWN. I COULD HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY THE STRESS OF TRAINING BEING DELAYED OR JUST COMPLACENCY IN WORKING THE SAME SECTORS CONTINUOUSLY AS WELL. I HONESTLY DON'T KNOW IF THESE WERE SUBCONSCIOUS FACTORS OR NOT; HOWEVER; AND I CAN SAY THAT I DON'T FEEL THEM ON CONSCIOUS LEVEL. I STRIVE TO DO MY BEST EVERY SINGLE DAY AND AM STILL MASSIVELY SHOCKED AND DISAPPOINTED IN WHAT OCCURRED TODAY. MY REFLECTIONS ARE ONGOING FROM THIS EVENT AND IT WILL ONLY INCREASE MY VIGILANCE IN THE FUTURE. I PLAN TO WATCH THE REPLAY ON MY NEXT WORKING DAY AND WILL AMEND THIS REPORT WITH ANY INFORMATION I FIND.AT THE TIME OF THIS EVENT; I CAN SAY THAT THE BIGGEST FACTOR THAT LED TO ME NOT OBSERVING THE OTHER TARGET WAS THE NEED TO MISS UNIDENTIFIED TARGETS CLOSE TO THE SFO BRAVO WITH AN ARRIVAL AT 5000 FT. THIS ARRIVAL ROUTE IS STANDARD FROM THE WOODSIDE SECTOR FOR ARRIVALS TO SJC. THIS ARRIVAL ROUTE HAS NUMEROUS ISSUES THAT I HAVE SEEN BE AT FACTOR BEFORE TODAY. FIRST OF ALL; IF AN AIRCRAFT COMES IN A 5000 FT. AND REQUIRES THE ILS; THE AIRCRAFT MUST BE CLIMBED TO 5100 FT. TO MEET MVA (MINIMUM VECTORING ALTITUDES) REQUIREMENTS NEAR KLIDE INTERSECTION; BUT HOOKS DOES NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO CLIMB THE AIRCRAFT FOR 10-15 MILES AND ONLY ABOUT 10 MILES FROM THE MVA BECAUSE OF THE CONFLICT WITH BOULDER'S AIRSPACE AT 6000 FT. WITHOUT A POINT OUT. THERE ARE ALSO PAO ARRIVALS; SQL ARRIVALS; AND NUQ ARRIVALS THAT CAN BE PUSHED TO DESCEND FROM THE SOUTH TO 4700 FT. AT A BARE MINIMUM UNTIL THEY ARE JUST EAST OF OSI; PUTTING THEM IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION CONFLICT WITH ARRIVALS AT 5000 FT. FROM WOODSIDE. IN THIS CASE; I DID NOT NEED TO CLIMB THE GULFSTREAM BECAUSE THE AIRCRAFT COULD GET A VISUAL APPROACH; AND WAS RESTRICTED FROM DOING SO BY AIRSPACE; SO I CHOSE TO VECTOR THE AIRCRAFT AROUND AN UNIDENTIFIED TARGET BECAUSE I COULD NOT GUARANTEE ALTITUDE. THE AIRCRAFT WAS CLOSE TO THE BRAVO BUT COULD HAVE GONE UP TO 4900 FT. WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE PROVIDED SEPARATION. THIS VECTOR REQUIRED CONCENTRATION THAT DISTRACTED ME FROM MONITORING AIRCRAFT X'S DESCENT FROM THE SOUTH; AS I WAS ALSO MISSING OTHER AIRCRAFT. AGAIN; I PRIDE MYSELF ON MY SCAN AND AM DISAPPOINTED AND SHOCKED THAT THE TARGET CAUSING THE RA WAS NOT OBSERVED CLIMBING FROM SEA LEVEL TO 9500 FT. WITHIN 8-10 NM. MY ONLY SUGGESTION FOR ARRIVALS FROM THE NORTHWEST IS THE POSSIBILITY OF 6000 FT. AND 7000 FT. INSTEAD OF 5000 FT. AND 7000 FT. TO HELP PROTECT THE CORRIDOR AND LEAVE AIRCRAFT IN THE BRAVO LONGER. AN EXTENSION OF THE BRAVO OR CHARLIE TO HELP PROTECT AIRCRAFT IN THE BAY AREA COULD HELP AS WELL AS NUMEROUS TARGETS STAY JUST ON THE FRINGES AT BAD ALTITUDES; CAUSING MORE HARM THAN GOOD. THIS IS A HOTSPOT ALMOST DAILY AND OPTIMIZED DESCENT PROFILES NEED TO BE BETTER PROTECTED WITH AIRCRAFT AT SUCH HIGH SPEEDS. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING; WHEN THE ODP'S WERE IMPLEMENTED THEY NOW PUT JETS IN AREAS THEY WEREN'T BEFORE; AND VFR PILOTS STILL HAVE LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF THE NEW ROUTES. THEY STAY IN PLACES THAT AVOIDED THE OLD ROUTES; WHICH NOW TEND TO PUT THEM IN MORE CONFLICT AREAS. EXTENSION OF CHARLIE OR BRAVO AIRSPACE TO PROTECT BAY AREA ARRIVALS WOULD BE IDEAL; BUT IT SEEMS THAT THIS IS NOT A PRIORITY DUE TO PUSHBACK FROM GA USERS. AGAIN; IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO SEPARATE FROM UNIDENTIFIED TARGETS AND I AM DISAPPOINTED THAT I WAS SO FOCUSED ON ONE THAT I MISSED THE OTHER. I PERSONALLY WILL BE EVEN MORE AWARE OF AIRCRAFT DEPARTING THE WVI AREA IN THE FUTURE; AS THEY HAVE PROVEN TO BE AN IMMEDIATE THREAT TO THE ARRIVAL CORRIDOR. THE SHORT DISTANCE WITH A HIGH PERFORMANCE AIRCRAFT LEAVES MINIMAL TIME TO REACT. I PRIDE MYSELF ON MY SCAN AND WILL BE EVEN MORE VIGILANT IN THE FUTURE TO DETECT ABNORMALITIES.,NorCal TRACON Controller reported an airborne conflict with an arrival aircraft and a jet that departed an uncontrolled airport.,2019,01
435,201901,CALIFORNIA,I WAS FLYING THREE PASSENGERS ON A NICE VFR DAY. WE WERE SOUTHBOUND AT 9500 APPROACHING BFL WHEN ALL THREE OF MY PASSENGERS NOTICED AND BROUGHT TO MY ATTENTION A BLACK-AND-RED COLOR DRONE WHICH PASSED RIGHT UNDERNEATH US; TRAVELING OPPOSITE DIRECTION; OFF OUR RIGHT WING; ABOUT 100 BELOW. I WAS SCANNING THE FLIGHT INSTRUMENTS AT THAT MOMENT AND DID NOT SEE THE DRONE. WE WERE CRUISING AT APPROX 175 KTAS; AND NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN. I QUESTIONED MY PASSENGERS TO MAKE SURE IT WAS NOT A MILITARY UAV OR A MANNED AIRCRAFT BECAUSE I WAS VERY SURPRISED TO SEE A RECREATIONAL DRONE AT 9400 MSL; AND ALL THREE OF MY PASSENGERS WERE ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE; AND DESCRIBED IT AS A MEDIUM SIZE BLACK-AND-RED DRONE. I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE NEAR MISS TO TRACON AND WE CONTINUED ON UNEVENTFULLY. I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SEEING A RECREATIONAL DRONE AT SUCH HIGH ALTITUDE WHERE MYSELF AND OTHERS ARE ROUTINELY FLYING AT HIGH SPEEDS; AND HAVE LITTLE TO NO CHANCE TO SEE A SMALL FLYING OBJECT AND AVOID A COLLISION WITH IT.,Pilot reported a NMAC with drone at 9500 ft.,2019,01
436,201901,CALIFORNIA,A TRAFFIC CONFLICT OCCURRED BETWEEN ME AND AN AIRPLANE FLYING THE ILS 26R KCNO AT 1600 FEET ON THE BOUNDARY OF ONTARIO CLASS C SURFACE AIRSPACE AND KCNO CLASS D AIRSPACE. ON INITIAL CLIMB TO KCNO; I CONTACTED KONT TOWER FOR CLEARANCE THROUGH THEIR AIRSPACE. I WAS GIVEN BEACON CODE 0222 AND TOLD TO CROSS MIDFIELD AT OR BELOW 2500 FEET. APPROACHING KCNO ON A RIGHT BASE FOR RUNWAY 26R; I BECAME CONCERNED THAT KONT HAD NOT HANDED ME OFF TO KCNO TOWER. AT THIS EXACT SAME TIME I HAD TO MAKE AN AGGRESSIVE RIGHT TURN TO AVOID TWO LARGE SOARING BIRDS (VULTURES). I THEN ASKED KONT IF THEY WANTED ME TO GO OVER TO KCNO TOWER TO WHICH THERE WAS NO REPLY. AT THIS TIME; MY ADS-B DISPLAYED A TRAFFIC WARNING AT 12 O'CLOCK AND 200 FEET BELOW ME SO I EXECUTED AN IMMEDIATE CLIMB AND SCANNED FOR THE TRAFFIC. I MADE ANOTHER CALL TO ONTARIO REGARDING THE HANDOFF AND WAS TOLD TO CONTACT KCNO TOWER. I HIT THE 'FLIP-FLOP' SWITCH INSTANTLY SELECTING KCNO TOWER ONLY TO HEAR KCNO TOWER CALLING OUT A TRAFFIC ALERT INSTRUCTING THE CONFLICTING TRAFFIC TO CLIMB. I NEVER SAW THE TRAFFIC AND AT THIS POINT THE ADS-B WARNING HAD DISAPPEARED. KCNO TOWER INSTANTLY GAVE ME CLEARANCE TO LAND RUNWAY 26R.UPON PARKING AT MY DESTINATION; I CALLED THE KCNO TOWER SUPERVISOR WHO ASKED IF I WAS TALKING TO ONTARIO. I REPLIED 'YES' AND GAVE HIM THE BEACON CODE 0222 THAT ONTARIO ASSIGNED ME AND VERIFIED THIS NUMBER BY REFERENCING MY TRANSPONDER. THE KCNO SUPERVISOR TOLD ME THAT ONTARIO INDICATED THEY HAD NOT BEEN WORKING MY FLIGHT. I RESPONDED THAT THAT WAS NOT ACCURATE AND RELAYED THE ABOVE NARRATIVE.I REVIEWED THE AIM 3-2-5A.; LA SECTIONAL AIRSPACE BOUNDARY DETAIL RELATIVE TO THE ILS 26R KCNO; JO 7110.65 PARAGRAPH 2-1-14A; 2-1-15B; 2-1-16 AND 2-1-17A; PART 91.129 AND 91.130. AFTER THIS REVIEW; I CALLED THE CHINO TOWER SUPERVISOR BACK TO RESOLVE THE INCONSISTENCY REGARDING ONTARIO TOWER'S STATEMENT THAT THEY WERE NOT IN CONTACT WITH ME. THE SUPERVISOR INDICATED THAT KONT HAD TRACKED ME WITH BEACON CODE 0220 AND NOT THE 0222 CODE THAT I HAD IN MY TRANSPONDER. THE SUPERVISOR SPECULATED THAT THIS BEACON CODE DISCREPANCY LIKELY RESULTED IN NO CALL SIGN ASSOCIATED WITH THE RADAR TARGET WHICH MAY EXPLAIN THE DELAY IN RESPONDING TO MY HANDOFF QUERY. HE ALSO STATED THAT; VIA A LETTER OF AGREEMENT WITH ONTARIO; ONTARIO SHOULD HAVE HANDED ME OFF MUCH FURTHER NORTH; OVER RIVERSIDE AVE. THE SUPERVISOR ALSO INDICATED THAT A LETTER OF AGREEMENT WITH ONTARIO WAS REQUIRED BECAUSE OF KONT CLASS C AIRSPACE THAT INFRINGES ON THE ILS 26R KCNO. THE KCNO TOWER SUPERVISOR INDICATED THAT DATA WAS BEING COLLECTED SHOWING SOME AIRCRAFT DEVIATING SOUTH WHILE FLYING THE ILS 26R TO AVOID THE KONT CLASS C SURFACE AREA.THE DISCUSSION WITH THE KCNO TOWER SUPERVISOR WAS INFORMATIVE AND PRODUCTIVE. THIS RESEARCH WAS FOR THE PURPOSE OF FINDING SOLUTIONS AND NOT TO LAY BLAME. AN EXPEDIENT CONCLUSION MAY TRY TO FAULT THE CONTROLLER FOR A LATE HANDOFF OR THE PILOT FOR NOT BEING MORE ASSERTIVE IN OBTAINING A TIMELY HANDOFF. MY REVIEW OF PART 91 OPERATING RULES INDICATES I WAS IN FULL COMPLIANCE. BOTH OF THESE APPROACHES WOULD MISS THE ROOT CAUSE OF THIS TRAFFIC CONFLICT. THE LOCATION OF THE KONT CLASS C AIRSPACE BOUNDARY.THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY BETWEEN KONT CLASS C AIRSPACE AND THE KCNO CLASS D IS LOCATED TOO FAR SOUTH CREATING A HAZARD FOR PILOTS AND UNNECESSARILY INCREASING THE WORKLOAD ON CONTROLLERS. IT IS UNSAFE FOR A PILOT TO DEVIATE FROM THE KCNO LOCALIZER INSIDE THE FAF IN ORDER TO AVOID KONT CLASS C AIRSPACE. A SEGMENT OF THE ILS 26R KCNO ACTUALLY LIES WITHIN THE KONT CLASS C AIRSPACE. A SOUTHBOUND AIRCRAFT IN KONT CLASS C AIRSPACE WILL NOT BE PROMPTED TO ASK FOR THE HANDOFF TO KCNO TOWER UNTIL PRECARIOUSLY CLOSE TO TRAFFIC ON THE ILS 26R KCNO. SINCE PILOTS ARE NOT PRIVY TO LETTERS OF AGREEMENT PLACING THE STANDARD HANDOFF MUCH FURTHER NORTH; THEY WOULD NOT RECOGNIZE A FAILED HANDOFF UNTIL MUCH TOO LATE. WITH THE BOUNDARY RELOCATED FURTHER NORTH; BOTH OF THESE HAZARDS WILL BE ELIMINATED.,A pilot on a right base reported a NMAC with another aircraft straight in on an instrument approach.,2019,01
437,201901,DC,I WAS TOLD TWICE BY THE TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT COORDINATOR AND THE SNOW TEAM COORDINATOR THAT RUNWAY 30 WAS OPEN. AIRCRAFT X WAS GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS TO LINE UP AND WAIT ON RUNWAY 30. I OBSERVED THE ADSE-X AND I DID NOT SEE ANY TARGETS ON THE RUNWAY. I WAS ALSO IN THE MIDDLE OF COORDINATING A CLOSURE FOR RUNWAY 1C DUE TO SNOW REMOVAL. IT WAS IFR AND THE VISIBILITY WAS HEAVILY RESTRICTED. I COULD NOT SEE THE ENTIRE RUNWAY. I COULD ONLY SEE THE FIRST 2;000 FEET OF THE RUNWAY AT BEST. AT NO POINT DID I OBSERVE A TARGET OR VEHICLE ON THE RUNWAY OR ADSE-X. AIRCRAFT X WAS GIVEN A DEPARTURE CLEARANCE AND A VECTOR TO THE SOUTHWEST. AIRCRAFT Y WAS GIVEN INSTRUCTIONS TO LINE UP AND WAIT ON RUNWAY 30. AS I WAS CLOSING RUNWAY 1C CENTER ON THE ADSE-X; THE ADSE-X ALERTED FOR RUNWAY 30. I DID NOT HEAR EXACTLY WHAT IT SAID BUT I AM QUITE SURE THAT IT DID NOT SAY RUNWAY 30 OCCUPIED. I THOUGHT I CLOSED THE WRONG RUNWAY WHEN I NOTICED AN UNIDENTIFIED TARGET MOVING TOWARDS AIRCRAFT X. THE TARGETS WERE MERGING AND AT MERGING POINT. WHEN AIRCRAFT X'S TARGET MOVED PASSED THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGET I ASKED THE PILOT IF HE WAS STILL THERE. THE PILOT STATED THAT IT WAS CLOSE. AFTER OBSERVING THE AIRCRAFT AIRBORNE ON RADAR AND ON THE ASSIGNED HEADING; I BELIEVE I SWITCHED THE AIRCRAFT TO POTOMAC APPROACH.I HAVE NOT HAD A CHANCE TO REVIEW THE TAPES OR ADSE-X PLAYBACK. I WILL AMEND THIS REPORT ONCE I HAVE A CHANCE TO REVIEW THE INCIDENT. AS MENTIONED EARLIER; I WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF CLOSING THE RUNWAY WHEN THE ADSE-X ALERTED. MY INITIAL ASSUMPTION WAS I CLOSED THE WRONG RUNWAY. I AM AWARE THAT MY REQUIREMENT IS TO ISSUE A CANCEL TAKEOFF CLEARANCE. BY THE TIME I NOTICED AND ASSESSED THE SITUATION; THE TARGETS WERE MERGING AND MERGED. THERE WAS NOTHING I COULD DO. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT RECOMMENDATIONS I CAN MAKE ON CURRENT PROCEDURES.,IAD Tower Controller and pilot reported a near collision on the runway between the aircraft and a snow removal vehicle.,2019,01
438,201901,FLORIDA,RECEIVED A CLIMBING TCAS RA ON DESCENT INTO VPS AT 6;000 FEET.NO TA WARNING; JUST OUT OF NOWHERE WE RECEIVED A RA TO CLIMB WITH AN (RED) ALERT -500 OFF OUR RIGHT WING. COMPLIED WITH RA; NOTIFYING ATC. FO (FIRST OFFICER) CLAIMS TO HAVE SEEN A MILITARY DRONE; AS WE WERE JUST OUTSIDE MILITARY AIRSPACE. I DID NOT SEE THE AIRCRAFT AT ALL. ATC REISSUED A NEW CLEARANCE WITH US; AND SEEMED TO BE UNCONCERNED BY OUR CLIMBING RA ALERT.CLOSE CALL WITH TCAS ALERT.,Air Carrier Captain reported receiving a TCAS RA which may have been caused by a military drone.,2019,01
439,201901,NEW JERSEY,VERY CLOSE TO COLLISION WITH A LARGE DRONE.,B737 flight crew reported a NMAC with drone.,2019,01
440,201901,WASHINGTON,AT 800 AGL CLIMBING OUT OF GEG OFF OF RWY 3 WE EXPERIENCED MULTIPLE BIRD STRIKES TO THE CAPTAIN'S WINDSHIELD AND RIGHT WING INBOARD SLAT. THE RVR FOR RWY 3 GEG WAS 800RVR SO WE DECIDED TO PROCEED TO OUR TAKEOFF ALTERNATE; WHERE THE WEATHER WAS VFR. ALTHOUGH CATIII WAS AVAILABLE TO RWY 3 IN GEG WE DECIDED THE SAFE COURSE OF ACTION WAS TO DIVERT TO A VFR AIRPORT THAT ALSO HAPPENED TO HAVE COMPANY MAINTENANCE. THE FLIGHT WAS COMPLETED SAFELY WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.,Air Carrier flight crew reported multiple bird strikes on departure led to a diversion.,2019,01
441,201902,ARIZONA,ON EXTENDED RIGHT BASE LEG TO 25R AT DVT; I OBSERVED AM AIRCRAFT; SIMILAR TO AN EXTRA 300; TRAVELING TO THE WEST (AS THOUGH IT WERE ON THE DOWNWIND TO [RUNWAY] 7L; AGAINST THE CURRENT TRAFFIC DIRECTION); PASSING IN FRONT OF ME AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE. THE AIRCRAFT WAS NOT IN COMMUNICATION WITH THE NORTH TOWER; WHICH I WAS IN CONTACT WITH AND HAD DIRECTED ME TO THE EXTENDED BASE LEG FOR [RUNWAY] 25R. I WAS A LITTLE ABOVE TRAFFIC PATTERN ALTITUDE AT ABOUT 2;700 FEET AS I WAS STILL DESCENDING; AND THE OTHER AIRCRAFT WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE ME. AS IT PASSED TO MY RIGHT AND WAS OFF MY RIGHT WING; IT DID A HALF SNAP ROLL AND DESCENDED VERTICALLY; AND AT THAT TIME; IT WAS APPARENT TO ME THAT IT WAS A LARGE RADIO CONTROLLED AIRCRAFT ABOVE THE SUN VALLEY FLIERS FIELD JUST NE OF DVT. AT THAT TIME; IT WAS ALSO EVIDENT THAT IT WAS A LOT CLOSER TO ME THAN I HAD ORIGINALLY ESTIMATED; SINCE IT WAS NOT A FULL-SIZED AIRCRAFT. I REPORTED THIS TO ATC WHEN IT HAPPENED SINCE THERE WERE OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE PATTERN AT THE TIME.,General aviation pilot reported a close encounter with a UAV while in the landing pattern at Phoenix Deer Valley Airport.,2019,02
442,201902,ARIZONA,ON EAGUL ARRIVAL FOR VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 8; PASSING OBASE; GIVEN CLEARANCE TO DESCEND FROM 6000 FT TO 4000 FT. AFTER INITIATING DESCENT; I POINTED OUT WHAT APPEARED TO BE A DRONE AT A ONE O'CLOCK POSITION. IT APPEARED TO BE A FEW HUNDRED FEET HIGHER AND STAYED TO THE NORTH OF OUR POSITION. WE DID NOT NEED TO MANEUVER THE AIRCRAFT AWAY FROM IT. ALERTED ATC CONTROLLER. REMAINDER OF FLIGHT UNEVENTFUL.,B737 Captain reported UAV sighting during a visual approach.,2019,02
443,201902,FLORIDA,WE HAD IN TRAIL RESTRICTIONS TO ATL AND CLT. WE HAD ALSO ALTITUDE CAPS ON THESE AIRPORTS OF FL330. THIS SECTOR OWNS FL240-FL350; THOUGH AT THE TIME THE ULTRA-HIGH SECTOR WAS COMBINED; GIVING US FROM FL240-600. I HAD A FULL EDST (ENROUTE DECISION SUPPORT TOOL) LIST OF AIRPLANES; WHICH FOR THIS SECTOR USUALLY IS A GOOD INDICATOR OF HOW BUSY WE ARE. IN ADDITION; WITH THE ATL AND CLT ALTITUDE CAPS; IT WAS FORCING HIGH PERFORMANCE BUSINESS JETS THAT WERE NORMALLY AT FL410 AND ABOVE DOWN INTO THE STRATUM WITH OTHER SLOWER PERFORMING AIRCRAFT. OVERALL; IT WAS A VERY COMPLEX SECTOR AND OPERATION AT THE TIME. AT THE TIME; WE GOT THE IN TRAIL REQUIREMENT FROM ZJX REGARDING ATL AND CLT; AS WELL AS THE ALTITUDE CAP; I ASKED MY SUPERVISOR TO SEE IF WE COULD GET SOME ALLEVIATION ON THE ALTITUDE CAPS BEING SO LOW. HE TOLD ME THAT HE HAD ASKED TMU (TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT UNIT) AND THEY SAID NO. I TOLD HIM THAT I WOULD NEED MORE THAN THE 15 MILES IN TRAIL THAT I HAD AND HE SAID THAT HE WOULD ASK FOR IT. A FEW MINUTES LATER; HE TOLD ME THAT TMU WOULD NOT GIVE IT TO HIM. ABOUT 5 MINUTES AFTER THAT; I TOLD HIM I WANTED 30 MILES IN TRAIL OUT OF HEDLY/ARKES/TBIRD FIXES; SINCE WE WERE GETTING SLAMMED WITH AIRCRAFT WHO WERE ALL AT SIMILAR ALTITUDES. I WOULD APPROXIMATE THAT CLT/ALT WAS PROBABLY 25% OF OUR TRAFFIC; AND NO ONE WAS FILING HIGHER. HE AGAIN SAID THAT THEY WOULD NOT GIVE IT TO US.FURTHER COMPOUNDING OUR COMPLEXITY PROBLEM IS THAT RECENTLY; WE INCORPORATED NEW METROPLEX PROCEDURES WHICH ARE VERY ROUGH; CAUSING AIRCRAFT WHO WOULD NORMALLY NOT BE IN CONFLICTION TO BE IN CONFLICTION IN NUMEROUS NEW SPOTS IN OUR SECTOR. SOME AIRCRAFT; WHICH WOULD NORMALLY FLY A 345 HEADING FOR 150 MILES; NOW FLY A 345 HEADING BEFORE TURNING TO A 320; BACK TO A 345; THEN TO A 360 HEADING. THIS MAKES THE CONFLICTION POINTS AT THE SECTOR SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OVER THE PREVIOUS AIRSPACE DESIGN; AND FURTHER COMPLICATES THE SECTOR. EVEN AIRCRAFT ON THE SAME ROUTE ARE NOW IN CONFLICTION BECAUSE THE RADICAL TURNS THAT THE ROUTES TAKE THEM ON TURN THEM INTO 100 KNOT HEADWIND. SO IF YOU HAVE 7 MILES BETWEEN AIRCRAFT IN TRAIL; AS THE FIRST ONE TURNS; HE SLOWS DOWN 100 KNOTS AND THE SECOND CATCHES HIM. IN ADDITION; SINCE THIS WAS JUST INCORPORATED TWO MONTHS AGO; AND JUST BEFORE OUR 'BUSY' TRAFFIC SEASON; WE ARE NOT AT ALL PROFICIENT ON IT. I HAD ASKED FOR 30 MILES IN TRAIL TO HELP ALLEVIATE THE ABOVE ISSUES; BUT WAS ULTIMATELY TOLD THAT I COULD NOT GET IT FOR UNKNOWN REASONS. ABOUT THAT TIME; AT OUR PEAK COMPLEXITY AND VOLUME; AN AIRCRAFT HAD A STUCK MIC FOR APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES. THIS CAUSED US TO ASK SECTOR 47 TO TRANSMIT A MESSAGE ON EMERGENCY GUARD; ASKING AIRCRAFT ON 125.07 TO CHECK THEIR MICS; BUT THE STUCK MIC CONTINUED. NORMALLY WHEN THIS HAPPENS; WE HAVE A BACKUP FREQUENCY FOR THE ULTRA-HIGH THAT WE WOULD THEN TRANSMIT ON. WE CAN MOVE PLANES; VIA GUARD; TO THE BACKUP FREQUENCY; AND THEN TALK TO THEM AND GIVE CONTROL INSTRUCTIONS. HOWEVER; THE ULTRA-HIGH SECTOR FREQUENCY WAS GIVEN TO SECTOR 23. WE ROUTINELY GIVE SECTOR 23 THIS FREQUENCY BECAUSE SECTOR 23 CONTROLS THE VIP TFR; WHICH IS UP TO 100 MILES SOUTH OF THEIR NORMAL AIRSPACE; AND THEIR FREQUENCY DOES NOT COVER IT APPROPRIATELY. RATHER THAN FIND THEM A FREQUENCY TO PERMANENTLY USE; WE LOSE SECTOR 68'S FREQUENCY SEVERAL WEEKS (AND MONTHS) OUT OF THE YEAR. THIS FURTHER COMPLICATES SECTOR 68; AS SECTOR 23'S FREQUENCY THAT WE GET DOES NOT COVER THE SECTOR ADEQUATELY. HOWEVER; IN THIS CASE; SECTOR 23'S FREQUENCY WAS NOT TEMP MODDED TO SECTOR 65; SO WE HAD NO BACKUP AND NO WAY TO ALLEVIATE THE STUCK MIC. IN ADDITION; SECTOR 64; WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN THE ONLY FREQUENCY THAT COULD HAVE HELPED US OFFLOAD TRAFFIC (WHO SITS NEXT TO US AND WHO WORKS SIMILAR TRAFFIC) WAS EQUALLY BUSY AND COMPLEX; SO THEY COULD NOT GET INVOLVED. AFTER APPROXIMATELY 5 MINUTES OF A STUCK MIC; WE GOT THE FREQUENCY BACK AND CONTINUED TO SEPARATE TRAFFIC AS NORMAL. WE DID NOT HAVE A LOSS; THOUGH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOSE SITUATIONS.SECTOR 68'S FREQUENCY SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN TO THE SECTOR 23 FOR 'HURRICANE SECTOR OPERATIONS'. THIS EVENT ABOVE PROVES SOME OF THE PERILS OF THAT. BUT THE FREQUENCY THAT SECTOR 23 GIVES US LACKS THE RADIO COVERAGE TO MAKE SECTOR 68 VIABLE; AND THEN WE CAN'T OPEN SECTOR 68 DURING PEAK TRAFFIC TIMES WITHOUT SERIOUSLY DEGRADED VOICE COMMUNICATIONS. SECTOR 23 SHOULD HAVE A NEW FREQUENCY CREATED FOR THEIR USE AS THEY HAVE ALREADY DONE WITH THEIR UHF. THAT SIDE WAS DONE IMMEDIATELY UNDER THE NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS; BUT THEY DIDN'T DO VHF BECAUSE THEY HAD BEEN USING THIS TEMPORARY PATCH. EITHER THAT OR MAKE THE TANKER USE UHF.AN IMMEDIATE FOLLOW UP AND REVISION ON THE NEW METROPLEX ROUTES SHOULD OCCUR SO THAT WE CAN REVISE THEM AND MAKE THEM LESS CONFLICTING. UNFORTUNATELY THIS WOULD HAVE OCCURRED BY NOW; BUT WITH THE GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN; THIS HAS PUT EVERY PROGRAM; INCLUDING THIS ONE; ON HOLD; AND IT'S JEOPARDIZING SAFETY. AS A TEMPORARY MEASURE; AFTER THE FACT AND A DATE LATE; WE HAVE TEMP MODDED THE SECTOR 23 FREQUENCY TO SECTOR 64 AND SECTOR 65; BUT THERE SHOULD BE A BETTER SOLUTION THAN A TEMP MOD. THESE HIGH ALTITUDE SECTORS DO NOT HAVE DEDICATED EMERGENCY GUARD SITES; AND THEREFORE CANNOT RELAY INSTRUCTIONS TO PILOTS WITHOUT GOING THROUGH ANOTHER SECTOR. THIS FURTHER COMPLICATES OUR ABILITY TO WORK TRAFFIC IN AN EMERGENCY SITUATION WHERE WE LOSE ALL OF OUR COMMS SUCH AS THIS INCIDENT.,ZMA Center Controller reported being unable to manage sectors well due to poor or non-existent radio coverage.,2019,02
444,201902,FLORIDA,LINED UP ON WRONG RUNWAY AT VRB ON VISUAL APPROACH. WEATHER WAS DAY VFR. INITIAL WEATHER INDICATED RUNWAY 4 LANDING. CREW BRIEFED AND EXECUTED APPROPRIATE CHECKLISTS. NEW WEATHER CAUSED CHANGE IN RUNWAY. FO (FIRST OFFICER) SET FMS AND SET APPROACH FOR RUNWAY 12. DUE TO HIGH VOLUMES OF LOCAL TRAINING TRAFFIC AND PARACHUTING I DID NOT CATCH HIM HITTING THE ACTUAL LOAD FUNCTION. I WAS DISTRACTED. SEVERAL BIRDS WERE ALSO OBSERVED WITH MORE DISTRACTION. WE WERE CLEARED FOR VISUAL TO RUNWAY 12. I ASKED [FOR] VECTORS TO FINAL TO BE EXECUTED. THE FO DID AS REQUESTED; HOWEVER [RUNWAY] 04 APPROACH POPPED UP. IN THE HEAT OF BATTLE AND DISTRACTIONS AT HAND WE MISSED THE [RUNWAY] 12 APPROACH. ATC HAD ALREADY CLEARED US FOR A VISUAL [BUT] WE DID NOT CATCH THE FACT THAT [RUNWAY] 4 WAS IN SEQUENCE. WE BEGAN VFR VISUAL SEQUENCING FOR WRONG APPROACH FOLLOWING FMS DATA. ATC QUERIED US AS WOULD BE EXPECTED. WE ASKED FOR SEQUENCING BACK AROUND FOR [RUNWAY] 12 [AND] WE LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. MORE DILIGENCE WHEN SETTING UP APPROACH SEQUENCE. CROSS CHECK AND CONFIRM EACH HAND MOVEMENT OF BUTTONS. DIVIDE TIME BETTER WITH ONCOMING APPROACH.,Air taxi Captain reported initially lining up on the wrong runway following distractions related to local traffic and bird activity.,2019,02
445,201902,GEORGIA,WHILE CONDUCTING THE RNAV 28 APPROACH INTO SAV; THE PIC SPOTTED WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LARGE RED/ORANGE/BLACK DRONE PASS OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT BY APPROXIMATELY 200 HUNDRED FEET WHILE LEVEL AT 1800 MSL AND 5 TO 6 MILES FROM THE RUNWAY. THE FIRST OFFICER DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT BUT DID REPORT THE POSSIBLE DRONE SIGHTING TO THE TOWER. NO EVASIVE MANEUVERS WERE REQUIRED AND THE APPROACH AND LANDING CONTINUED WITHOUT INCIDENT. AFTER SHUTDOWN; ONE OF THE PASSENGERS REPORTED TO THE CREW THAT THEY HAD ALSO SEEN A DRONE PASS OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE PIC THEN MADE A FOLLOW-UP PHONE CALL TO THE TOWER TO CONFIRM THE DRONE SIGHTING.,Light transport Captain reported sighting a UAV while on RNAV 28 Approach to SAV.,2019,02
446,201902,ILLINOIS,WE WERE ARRIVING INTO ORD ON THE VEECK ARRIVAL. WE WERE LEVEL AT 11;000 FT. ABOUT 8.5NM SOUTH OF CLUSO INTERSECTION. AS WE WERE RECEIVING INSTRUCTIONS FROM ATC; I WAS HEADS UP AND SAW A BLACK OBJECT ON THE HORIZON APPROACHING. AT FIRST; I THOUGHT IT WAS A MYLAR BALLOON; BUT AS IT APPROACHED; I COULD EASILY SEE THAT IT WAS IRREGULAR IN SHAPE. AS IT CAME CLOSER; IT WAS CLEARLY AN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT. IT WAS ALL BLACK; AND MULTI-ROTOR. IT PASSED OUR LEFT WING AT OUR ALTITUDE. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE HOW FAR AWAY IT WAS; BUT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN MORE THAN 1;000 FT. AWAY DUE TO THE DETAILS I COULD SEE. IT WAS LIKELY CLOSER THAN THAT. THE CAPTAIN WAS HEADS DOWN AT THE TIME; AND ON THE RADIO; AND DIDN'T SEE THE [OBJECT]. SHE REPORTED IT TO ATC. WE DIDN'T CALL IT A NMAC AT THAT MOMENT; BUT PROBABLY SHOULD HAVE. WE WERE BUSY WITH ATC INSTRUCTIONS FOR HEADING; ALTITUDE; AND AIRSPEED CHANGES. THE REST OF THE FLIGHT CONTINUED UNEVENTFULLY.,B737 pilot reported sighting a drone while on the VEECK arrival into O'Hare airport at 11;000 feet.,2019,02
447,201902,LOUISIANA,AIRCRAFT WAS ON ABOUT A 1/2 MILE RIGHT BASE FOR RWY 36R AND CLEARED TO LAND. AS HE WAS TURNING FINAL; HE REPORTED A DRONE SIGHTING ABOUT 400-500 FT. AWAY FROM HIS AIRCRAFT. DO NOT ALLOW ANY DRONE ACTIVITY IN ANY CONTROLLED AIRSPACE; REGARDLESS OF ALTITUDE.,Controller reported that a pilot reported encountering a drone while on a visual approach to New Orleans Lakefront airport.,2019,02
448,201902,LOUISIANA,DURING DESCENT; MSY APPROACH INFORMED US THAT 4 DRONES HAD BEEN REPORTED AT 800 FT. ON THE LOCALIZER AND GLIDE SLOPE FOR RUNWAY 11. [TWO AIRCRAFT FROM TWO DIFFERENT AIR CARRIERS] COMPLETED THE APPROACH AND LANDED AFTER THE FIRST REPORT AND REPORTED NO SIGHTING BEFORE WE ACCEPTED AN APPROACH CLEARANCE. WE CONTINUED TO A NORMAL APPROACH AND LANDING AND DID NOT OBSERVE ANY DRONE ACTIVITY. WE HAVE NO GUIDANCE IN OUR MANUALS FOR WHAT ACTION TO TAKE WHEN RECEIVING A REPORT OF DRONES. AS DRONES ARE BECOMING A MORE COMMON THREAT; I RECOMMEND THAT FLIGHT OPS DEVELOPS GUIDANCE FOR CREWS. SPECIFICALLY; IT WOULD HELP TO HAVE A FRAMEWORK FOR WHAT IS A CREDIBLE THREAT FOR AIRCRAFT SAFETY AND IN WHAT CASES FLIGHT THROUGH AIRSPACE WHERE SUCH REPORTS HAS BEEN MADE SHOULD BE AVOIDED. IT WOULD ALSO BE HELPFUL TO HAVE REPORTING PROCEDURES AND MITIGATION STRATEGIES AVAILABLE.,Air carrier Pilot reported being advised by ATC while on approach to MSY that four drones had been sighted below 1000 feet in the final approach corridor to Runway 11.,2019,02
449,201902,PENNSYLVANIA,WE ENCOUNTERED A DRONE DURING THE APPROACH PHASE (ILS 27R) IN PHL. THE DRONE WAS AT OUR ALTITUDE (2;800 MSL) NEAR THE MRTIN INITIAL APPROACH FIX FOR THE ILS 27R. WE WERE INTERCEPTING THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE AND WERE DESCENDING TO A LOWER ALTITUDE. I WAS THE PILOT MONITORING. I SAW A DRONE (CHROME AND BLUE IN COLOR) PASSING OFF MY FRONT/RIGHT (1 O'CLOCK) AT OUR ALTITUDE. I ESTIMATE THE DISTANCE BETWEEN THE DRONE AND OUR AIRCRAFT AT 200 METERS. I'D ESTIMATE THE SIZE OF THE DRONE AT APPROXIMATELY 3 X 3 FEET.THE LOW ANGLE OF THE SUN CONTRIBUTED TO THE ENHANCED VISIBILITY OF THE DRONE. [THE CAPTAIN AND I] SPECULATED THAT IT WAS NO COINCIDENCE THAT THE DRONE WAS AT THE PRECISE LOCATION AND ALTITUDE THAT US AND OTHER AIRCRAFT WERE TURNING FINAL INTO KPHL. PERHAPS THE OPERATOR WAS GETTING VIDEO FOOTAGE OF ARRIVING AIRCRAFT.,Airbus flight crew reported sighting a UAV while intercepting the final approach course for the ILS27R at PHL.,2019,02
450,201902,TENNESSEE,[BNA] ILS 20L. FLIGHT AND MAJORITY OF APPROACH UNEVENTFUL. WE BROKE OUT OF THE CLOUDS AT ABOUT 700 FEET ON THE APPROACH. AT THE 500 FEET CALL OUT; I OBSERVED A RATHER LARGE PARTY BALLOON ALONG OUR FLIGHT PATH. I DISCONNECTED THE AUTO PILOT AND MANEUVERED TO THE RIGHT TO AVOID HITTING IT. THIS MANEUVER WAS FOLLOWED BY A GO-AROUND DUE TO THE APPROACH NOT BEING STABILIZED. I CALLED FOR THE GO-AROUND THEN WE FOLLOWED THE MISSED APPROACH. INDIVIDUALS ON THE GROUND SHOULD FIND A BETTER WAY TO SECURE THEIR PARTY BALLOONS.,CRJ-900 Captain reported executing a go-around from their approach to BNA after spotting a party balloon on their flight path at about 500 feet AGL.,2019,02
451,201902,UTAH,WE WERE JUST INSIDE THE OUTER MARKER FOR RWY 34R AT APPROXIMATELY 5700 FT ON FINAL. A DRONE WAS SPOTTED BY BOTH MYSELF AND MY FIRST OFFICER APPROXIMATELY 100 FT OR LESS PASSING OFF OUR RIGHT SIDE. THE DRONE WAS TRAVELING SOUTH. IT WAS JUST OFF OUR RIGHT WING. IT WAS A GOOD SIZED DRONE WITH RED AND GREEN NAVIGATION LIGHTS. SOMEONE WAS FLYING DRONES IN AN UNAUTHORIZED AREA. SUGGEST BETTER WAYS TO TRACK DRONE OPERATORS.,A321 Captain reported sighting a nearby UAV while on approach to 34R at Salt Lake City.,2019,02
452,201902,UTAH,ON APPROACH INTO SALT LAKE CITY AT 5;300 FT I NOTICED A DRONE PASS OFF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT AT OUR ALTITUDE WITHIN 100 FT OF THE RIGHT WING TIP. SALT LAKE APPROACH WARNED US ABOUT A GREEN LASER EVENT AND SHORTLY THEREAFTER I SEE THE DRONE; REPORTED THE SIGHTING AND LANDED SAFELY.,Air carrier pilot reported that a UAV was spotted within 100' of right wing-tip on approach to SLC.,2019,02
453,201902,WASHINGTON,I FLEW MY DRONE AS A HOBBYIST IN AN AREA NEAR SEATTLE WHICH I SUBSEQUENTLY LEARNED REQUIRES NOTIFICATION AND APPROVAL FROM THE DIRECTOR AND ATC AT BOEING FIELD. I CALLED THERE AND APOLOGIZED FOR MY OVERSIGHT AND WAS INFORMED I NEED TO FILL OUT AN ONLINE APPLICATION WITH A 60-90 DAY APPROVAL. I APOLOGIZE FOR MY LACK OF AWARENESS ON THIS AND SPOKE TO A FRIEND WHO IS A PILOT; AND HE SUGGESTED I SUBMIT THIS FORM FOR NOTIFICATION. I WILL NOT BE FLYING MY DRONE FURTHER AROUND MY HOUSE UNTIL I'VE FULLY RESEARCHED AND UNDERSTOOD ALL THE REGULATIONS AROUND FLYING IT. I HAVE DOWNLOADED THE B4UFLY APP TO ENSURE I'M AWARE OF FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS AS WELL. IF THERE IS ANYTHING FURTHER I NEED TO DO REGARDING YESTERDAY'S DRONE OPERATION; PLEASE LET ME KNOW.,UAV operator reported operating his UAV in an area without the proper authorization from the local ATC facility.,2019,02
454,201903,CALIFORNIA,AIRCRAFT X WAS INBOUND FROM THE SOUTH MAKING LEFT TRAFFIC TO RUNWAY 31. THE AIRCRAFT FIRST MADE A REPORT ON FREQUENCY ABOUT PASSING A DRONE; WITH FEW DETAILS AND NO CALL SIGN. SUBSEQUENT BACK AND FORTH ESTABLISHED THAT AIRCRAFT X PASSED A DRONE AROUND THE STANFORD UNIVERSITY AT APPROXIMATELY ONE THOUSAND ONE HUNDRED FEET. THEY REPORTED TO PASS ABOUT ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED FEET FROM THE DRONE AND THAT THEY HAD TO DESCEND TO AVOID HITTING IT. IT WAS REPORTED TO BE A BLACK AND WHITE QUAD COPTER ESTIMATED TO WEIGH BETWEEN TEN AND FIFTEEN POUNDS. I IMMEDIATELY MADE SURE THE CIC (CONTROLLER-IN-CHARGE) HEARD THE REPORT AND TRIED TO FACILITATE INFORMATION REQUESTS THE CIC AND THE PILOT.THE MAIN CIC COMPUTER HAS BEEN REPLACED RECENTLY AND NO LONGER HAS THE QUICK LINK FOR UAS (UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEM) ACTIVITY AUTHORIZATIONS IN THE VICINITY. SO I CAN'T SPEAK TO WHETHER OR NOT THE UAS WAS AUTHORIZED OR NOT. BUT; AT THAT LOCATION (WHICH WAS AROUND THE EDGE OF THE PAO CLASS D) AND ALTITUDE REGULARLY HAS AIR TRAFFIC AND UAS ACTIVITY SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO CALL PALO ALTO TOWER.THE LINK FOR CHECKING UAS AUTHORIZATIONS NEEDS TO BE ADDED BACK TO THE CIC COMPUTER.,PAO Tower Controller reported an airborne conflict between an aircraft under their control and a drone.,2019,03
455,201903,CALIFORNIA,I WAS THE PF (PILOT FLYING). I WAS RECEIVING MY ANNUAL LINE CHECK FROM LCA (LINE CHECK AIRMAN) CAPTAIN. THE FLIGHT UP TO THIS POINT HAD PROCEEDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. WE WERE CLEARED FOR THE VISUAL APPROACH 24R AT LAX. TOUCHDOWN WAS WITHIN THE TOUCHDOWN ZONE WITH A FAIRLY GUSTY RIGHT CROSSWIND. DURING THE ROLLOUT PHASE; WITH THE REVERSERS OUT; WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO 'ROLL TO THE END BB; I'LL CALL YOUR TURN OFF THE RUNWAY.' TO WHICH MY FO (FIRST OFFICER) REPLIED; 'ROLL TO BB.' WE THEN CONTINUED PAST Z AND AA AND TURNED OFF ON BB. IT WAS ONLY AFTER MAKING THE TURN AT BB DID I NOTICE SUPER DEPARTING 24L IN HIS ROTATION PHASE BETWEEN Z AND AA. WE HELD SHORT OF 24L ON BB. AFTER THE A380 HAD DEPARTED; WE WERE CLEARED TO CROSS 24L AND CONTACTED NORTH GROUND. NORTH GROUND INSTRUCTED US TO TAXI VIA THE BRIDGE ROUTE. AFTER SWITCHING TO SOUTH GROUND WE WERE TOLD TO COPY A PHONE NUMBER FOR A POSSIBLE PILOT DEVIATION. WE BLOCKED INTO GATE AND SHUT DOWN. AT THAT POINT I ASKED [CHECK CAPTAIN] IF HE HEARD OR SEEN ANYTHING THAT WE COULD HAVE POSSIBLY DONE WRONG. AN OBSERVER; WITH A BIRD'S EYE VIEW; OFTEN SEES TRENDS AND DEVELOPMENTS THAT PILOTS DON'T NOTICE. IN THIS CASE; [HE] DIDN'T SEE ANY SAFETY; PROCEDURAL OR ATC CONCERNS. [ATC WAS] RESEARCHING WHETHER WE HAD DEVIATED ATC INSTRUCTIONS DURING THE LANDING ROLL OUT. [ATC STATED] THAT WITH AN A380 DEPARTING 24L; THE TOWER CONTROLLERS MUST MAINTAIN A SAFETY AREA. THEY CANNOT HAVE ANY AIRCRAFT HOLDING IN BETWEEN 24L AND 24R. WITH THAT IN MIND WE SHOULD HAVE NOT TURNED ONTO BB. ESSENTIALLY; THE TOWER CONTROLLER GAVE ME A NON-STANDARD; IMPROVISED LASHO CLEARANCE DURING A CRITICAL PHASE OF FLIGHT WHILE I WAS MANAGING THE DECELERATING ENERGY OF OUR AIRCRAFT IN GUSTY CROSSWIND CONDITIONS. THESE INSTRUCTIONS WERE GIVEN WHILE WE WERE USING MAX REVERSE CAUSING ADDED NOISE TO CLEARLY HEAR ATC'S UNUSUAL HOLD SHORT INSTRUCTIONS. ALL I HEARD WAS 'ROLL DOWN TO BB.' NO PROBLEM. NOT SURE WHY I NEEDED TO PASS UP Z OR AA AS THOSE ARE NO LONGER FULL; BUT I WILL COMPLY WITH THE CONTROLLER'S REQUEST. WHEN I HEARD; 'BB' THAT TO ME MEANT; TURN OFF ON BB. WHY WOULD IT NOT? ON FINAL; HAD THE CONTROLLER SAID SOMETHING SPECIFIC LIKE: HEAD'S UP; AIRCRAFT X; DEPARTING SUPER ON 24L; PLAN ON ROLLING TO THE END AND HOLD SHORT OF BB ON 24R.' EVEN BETTER; THE CONTROLLER COULD HAVE DELAYED [A380'S] DEPARTURE FOR 20 MORE SECONDS AND ALLOWED US TO CLEAR 24L BEHIND [ANOTHER AIRCRAFT]. AT THAT POINT; 24R AND THE SAFETY ZONE WOULD HAVE BEEN CLEAR. AS PILOTS WE GET NERVOUS WHEN WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME ON THE RUNWAY AFTER LANDING. IT IS NOT INTUITIVE TO ROLL DOWN TO AN AVAILABLE TAXIWAY; STOP THE AIRCRAFT AND STAY ON THE RUNWAY. I ALWAYS ASSUME TRAFFIC IS LANDING BEHIND US AND I FELT UNEASY AS IT WAS TO ROLL PAST AA. NOW I WAS SUPPOSED TO STAY ON THE RUNWAY?! NOWHERE IN THE LAX REFERENCE CHARTS; TAXI CHARTS OR [COMPANY] 10-7 PLATES DOES IT MENTION THE ATC SAFETY AREA FOR A380'S DEPARTING 24L. AT 100 KNOTS ON LANDING; HOW ARE WE TO INTERPRET THAT A CONTROLLERS COMMENT; 'I'LL CALL YOUR TURN OFF THE RUNWAY;' MEANS THAT IF A SUPER WERE TO ABORT ITS TAKEOFF; ITS RIGHT WINGTIP WOULD STRIKE YOUR AIRPLANE IF WERE HOLDING BETWEEN THE RUNWAYS. AS HE WAS BEHIND US; WE DIDN'T REALIZE A SUPER WAS DEPARTING THE INBOUND RUNWAY UNTIL WE TURNED THE AIRCRAFT ONTO BB. IN THE DOZENS OF TIMES I'VE REVIEWED THIS SCENARIO IN MY MIND; BASED ON THE SPLIT SECOND INFORMATION I HAD AT THE TIME; AT 100 KNOTS; I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME THING AGAIN. HOWEVER; BASED ON THIS NEW INFORMATION FROM THE TOWER; I NOW HAVE THE INSIDE KNOWLEDGE OF THE AIRBUS A380 SAFETY ZONE AND THE CONTROLLERS CRYPTIC; 'I'LL CALL YOUR TURN OFF THE RUNWAY;' NOW MAKES SENSE AND I'D KNOW FOR NEXT TIME. BUT HOW DO YOU CONVEY ALL THAT INFORMATION TO A PILOT DURING THE LANDING PHASE. QUITE SIMPLY; YOU DON'T. IT NEEDS TO BE BRIEFED AHEAD OF TIME; THROUGH SAFETY BULLETINS AND NOTES IN THE JEPPESEN PLATES. [COMPANY] FLIGHT OPS NEEDS TO GET THIS INFORMATION OUT TO ALL [COMPANY] PILOTS. WECAN'T JUST RELY ON TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE THAT A CLEARANCE LIKE THIS MAY OCCUR AND WHY. IT MAKES SENSE NOW THAT IT'S BEEN EXPLAINED TO ME; BUT SUCH NON-STANDARD PHRASEOLOGY IN OUR CASE WASN'T CLEAR AT THE TIME. I ALSO ENCOURAGE LAX TO PUT SOMETHING ON THE PAGE ABOUT THE SAFETY ZONE FOR DEPARTING A380'S. IN 7 YEARS OF BEING BASED IN LAX; I HAD NO IDEA THE 'SUPER A380 SAFETY ZONE' EXISTED. I KNEW THERE WERE IN-TRAIL SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS; BUT HAD NO IDEA THERE WERE ALSO LATERAL REQUIREMENTS UNIQUE TO THE NORTH COMPLEX AT LAX. THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE. THIS INFORMATION NEEDS TO BE SHARED TO ALL PILOTS OPERATING IN/OUT OF LAX.,Air carrier pilot reported a taxiway incursion at LAX airport. Reporter cited non-standard phraseology as a contributing factor.,2019,03
456,201903,GEORGIA,FIRST FLIGHT UNDER PART 107 RULES. I FILED A FLIGHT PLAN USING AIRMAP AND B4UFLY APPS TO DO A ROOF INSPECTION USING A DJI INSPIRE 1. THE INFORMATION I WAS GIVEN BY BOTH APPS WAS TO BE CAREFUL FLYING IN FTY CLASS D AIRSPACE. I CALLED THE TOWER CHIEF AND HE SUGGESTED THAT I FILE FOR A WAIVER. I FIGURED SINCE B4UFLY APP WAS A FAA APP AND IT SAID JUST TO BE CAREFUL FLYING WITHIN 5 MILES OF AN AIRPORT; I WENT WITH IT. AS SOON AS I CAME TO A 2 FOOT HOVER; I GOT WARNINGS ON MY DJI APP AND IMMEDIATELY SET IT DOWN; PACKED IT UP AND REVIEWED THE SECTIONAL CHARTS AGAIN. AFTER FURTHER REVIEW; I FOUND THE WEBSITE I SHOULD HAVE USED TO FILE A WAIVER; FAADRONEZONE.FAA.GOV; TO FILE FOR WAIVERS NEXT TIME.,UAV operator reported failure to obtain an FAA waiver before operating within FTY Class D airspace.,2019,03
457,201903,INDIANA,STAFFING WAS VERY SHORT THIS MORNING. THE SUPERVISOR WAS ON THE PHONE CALLING FOR OVERTIME WHEN I CAME INTO THE AREA. WE WERE ALL WORKING SECTORS WITHOUT A D-SIDE BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF STAFFING. I SAT DOWN AND WORKED OUR LOW ALTITUDE SECTORS COMBINED AT PKB LO. THIS MEANS CMH LO AND PIK LO WERE COMBINED WITH PKB LO. I WORKED UNTIL I WAS FORCED OUT AND TOOK A 40 MINUTE BREAK. WHEN I CAME BACK FROM BREAK; THE CONTROLLER I RELIEVED SAID THAT THE SECTORS JUST BLEW UP WITH TRAFFIC AFTER I LEFT. THE BRUSHY CREEK MOA BELOW 50; BUCKEYE MOA AND ATCAA 50B500; CHARLIE A ATCAA 190B500; CHARLIE B 190B220 WERE IN USE WITH 2 GROUPS OF F16S STILL ACTIVELY USING IT. SO I ACCEPTED THE RELIEF BRIEFING AND WORKED THE SECTORS WITHOUT A D-SIDE. WELL; THE SECTORS' TRAFFIC QUICKLY ESCALATED. I HAD A MILITARY [AIRCRAFT] REQUESTING VECTORS FOR THE VOR21 CIR 03 AT PKB. I HAD 3 AIRCRAFT IN MY AIRSPACE DOING VFR PHOTO WORK IN VERY ACTIVE PATHS OF AIRSPACE; 2 OF WHICH FLEW THROUGH OTHER FACILITIES' AIRSPACE AS PART OF THEIR PATH. I HAD MULTIPLE DEPARTURES AND A ZZV ARRIVAL. THE ZZV FREQUENCY HAD CROSS TALK ON OUR MAIN AND STANDBY RECEIVERS. THE BUECS [BACKUP EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION] FOR ZZV WERE FINE; BUT I NEEDED TO STAY ON THE MAIN AND STANDBY FOR THE ZZV ARRIVAL. NOT TO MENTION WE HAVE OUR STANDARD PIK LO FREQUENCY THAT IS LOCATED AT 2 DIFFERENT SITES THAT WE ALWAYS NEED TO BOUNCE BACK AND FORTH IN SELECTION FOR AIRCRAFT COVERAGE. THE PKB LO FREQUENCY WAS FINE; BUT NONE OF THESE FREQUENCIES ARE CROSS COUPLED; SO THE AIRCRAFT ARE ALWAYS TALKING ALL OVER EACH OTHER. SO; IN THE THICK OF THINGS AND ONE SET OF F16S CALLS TO LEAVE AS SINGLE SHIPS. I TELL THEM TO STAY IN THE MOA UNTIL I CAN GET THEM THEIR CLEARANCES. I CHANGE THE F16 FLIGHT PLAN TO REFLECT ONLY ONE SHIP AND ROUTE IT INTO DIRECT TOL. I START A VP [VFR PLAN; (CONTROLLER STARTS A TAG AND THEN BUILDS A FLIGHT PLAN)] FLIGHT PLAN ON THE SECOND F16 THAT WANTS TO GO TO FFO. I ISSUE THE FIRST CLEARANCE TO THE F16 GOING TO TOL. AT THIS TIME I AM ALSO ANSWERING OTHER AIRCRAFT AND WORKING THROUGH THE SECTORS. A RADAR ASSOCIATE CONTROLLER THEN ARRIVES. HE CAME IN EARLY FOR HIS SHIFT; PER THE SUPERVISOR'S CALL FOR OVERTIME. I WAS VERY GLAD TO SEE HIM! I RADAR IDENTIFY THE SECOND AIRCRAFT GOING TO FFO AND ISSUE HIS CLEARANCE. HE IS POINTED OUT TO THE ADJACENT SECTOR; BUT CMH APPROACH CALLS AND TELLS THE D-SIDE THAT FFO IS CLOSED. I TELL THE F16 THE STATUS OF FFO. THE F16 SAYS HE HAS PRIOR APPROVAL TO LAND FOR CERTIFICATION OF ITEMS AT FFO. I CALL CMH APPROACH BACK AND CMH SAYS THAT THERE ARE DRONES AT FFO AND THAT FFO WAS TRYING TO GET THE DRONES OUT OF THE WAY ASAP. I EXPLAIN IT TO THE F16 WHO IS NOW 15NM NW OF MY AIRSPACE. CMH APPROACH HAS THE HAND OFF AND THE F16 ASKS IF HE COULD JUST HOLD IN THE BUCKEYE MOA. AT THIS POINT WITH ALL THIS COMMUNICATION TAKING PLACE; I AM FAR BEHIND IN GETTING OTHER THINGS DONE. MY RADAR ASSOCIATE CONTROLLER IS CERTIFIED; BUT HE IS VERY NEW AND NOT WELL VERSED IN UNUSUAL SITUATIONS. I JUST TELL THE F16 THAT HE WILL HAVE TO HOLD WITH CMH APCH UNTIL THE DRONES ARE CLEARED AND SWITCH HIM TO CMH APCH. I TAKE CARE OF A FEW OTHER THINGS; SUCH AS VECTORING FOR THE VOR 21 APCH AND ISSUING CROSSING RESTRICTIONS AND FREQUENCY CHANGES. THE NEXT SET OF F16S WANT TO LEAVE. AIRCRAFT X; A VFR FROM CKB APPROACH WANTS TO START HIS PHOTO WORK. HE IS SETTING UP FOR HIS LINE OF FLIGHT EASTBOUND AND HEADS FOR ANOTHER AIRCRAFT THAT IS VFR/65 INBOUND TO PKB. I CALL THE TRAFFIC TO BOTH AIRCRAFT AND VECTOR THE INBOUND TO PKB. THE PKB ARRIVAL HAS AIRCRAFT X IN SIGHT. AIRCRAFT X SAYS HE IS HAVING PROBLEMS WITH SOME OF HIS EQUIPMENT AND WANTS TO ORBIT UNTIL IT GETS FIXED. AIRCRAFT X STARTS HIS TURNS (OF WHICH ARE LEFT AND RIGHT AND NOT REALLY AN ORBIT) AND THEN IS TRAFFIC AGAIN WITH THE PKB ARRIVAL. I CALL TRAFFIC AND VECTOR AGAIN. I ISSUE THE CLEARANCE TO THE F16S OUT OF THE BUCKEYE MOA AND HAND THEM OFF. I FREQUENCY SWITCH SEVERAL AIRCRAFT. I SCAN BACK AROUND AND NOTICE THAT AIRCRAFT X IS ENTERING CKB APPROACH AIRSPACE; HEADING NORTHBOUND. I ASK THE D-SIDE TO CALL CKB APPROACH AND UPDATE THEM ABOUT AIRCRAFT X. THE D-SIDE SAYS HE REALLY DOESN'T KNOW IF CKB EVER RECEIVED A POINT OUT. I THINK ABOUT IT AND WONDER IF CKB APPROACH EVER KNEW THAT THIS AIRCRAFT WAS GOING TO DO PHOTO WORK. SO I CALL CKB APPROACH AND DO THE LATE POINT OUT. AIRCRAFT X WAS APPROXIMATELY AT [WAYPOINT] AND HEADING NORTHBOUND TO START HIS FIRST LINE FOR ABOUT 15 NM AND THEN SOUTHBOUND ABOUT 50-60NM; HEADING WESTERLY ON EACH TRACK. THE REASON FOR THIS REPORT IS THAT I VIOLATED CKB APPCH'S AIRSPACE WITH AIRCRAFT X. I THEN CONTINUED TO PLUG AWAY AT THE SECTORS. UPON HEARING DURING THE RELIEF BRIEFING THAT THE SECTOR BLEW UP; I SHOULD HAVE ASKED THE SUPERVISOR FOR A D-SIDE. HOWEVER; THE SECTORS WERE VERY QUIET. THE EDST [ENROUTE DECISION SUPPORT TOOL] DID NOT HAVE MANY AIRCRAFT IN THE ACTIVE FP [FLIGHT PLAN] LIST. IT IS VERY HARD TO ASK FOR SECTORS TO BE SPLIT OUT WHEN THE SECTORS ARE THIS SLOW. HOWEVER; AS I WROTE IN THE PREVIOUS NARRATIVE; THE SECTORS BLOW UP VERY QUICKLY. WITH THE FREQUENCY ISSUES; 7 ADJACENT APPROACH CONTROLS; 2 ADJACENT ARTCCS; A VFR TWR (PKB); A BUSY FLIGHT SCHOOL; SEVERAL UNCONTROLLED AIRPORTS THAT WERE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR (HOC; EOP; GEO; AMT; 22I; I71; ZZV; 42I; I40; 10G; AND I10) ; AND THE BRUSH CREEK MOA; BUCKEYE MOA AND ATCAA ABOVE IT; CHARLIE A ATCAA; AND CHARLIE B ATCAA (OF WHICH ALL ALTITUDES WE MUST MONITOR WHEN IT IS HOT---WHICH IS USUALLY UP TO FL500); AND THE MONITORING OF THE TACTICAL FREQUENCY FOR THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT; IT ALL GETS VERY BUSY IMMEDIATELY. ANYTHING OUT THE ORDINARY; SUCH AS THE FFO DRONE ISSUE; CAUSES THE COMPLEXITY TO CLIMB WITH OTHER CLEARANCES NOT BEING COMPLETED BECAUSE THE FREQUENCY AND COORDINATION TIED UP DEALING WITH THE ISSUE. THE ADJACENT FACILITIES AT TIMES DO NOT HAVE MUCH PATIENCE WITH US. SOMETIMES WE CANNOT ANSWER THE LINE AUTOMATICALLY. SOMETIMES WE CANNOT TAKE A HANDOFF FROM APPROACH CONTROL; THE AIRCRAFT MAY HAVE TO LEVEL IN APPROACH CONTROL ALTITUDES UNTIL WE CAN GET TO IT. OBVIOUSLY; THE D-SIDE WAS NOT ENOUGH HELP FOR ME. I NEEDED A TRACKER. NEXT TIME I WILL CALL FOR A TRACKER. I DOUBT THAT WE HAD SOMEONE AVAILABLE; BUT THE SUPERVISOR COULD HAVE PAGED SOMEONE BACK AFTER A FEW MINUTES ON BREAK. AS SUMMER IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING WITH MORE LOW ALTITUDE AIRCRAFT ASKING FOR ADVISORIES AND MORE PHOTO SURVEYS; I MUST SAY THE WORDS; 'I NEED A TRACKER.' I NEVER CALLED CKB APPROACH BACK TO SEE IF THEY WERE ACTUALLY ALREADY WATCHING AIRCRAFT X SINCE HE DID DEPART FROM ONE OF THEIR AIRPORTS (MGW). ONE MUST NEVER ASSUME. I SHOULD HAVE CLARIFIED AIRCRAFT X'S FIRST LINE FOR HIS PHOTO SURVEY WORK AND CALLED CKB APPROACH TO POINT HIM OUT. I WILL DO THIS NEXT TIME. NEXT TIME; I WILL ALSO BE TELLING THE TRACKER TO DO THE COORDINATION. THANKS FOR YOUR PATIENCE IN READING THIS.,Indianapolis Center Controller reported several concerns occurring during a session; which resulted in an airspace deviation.,2019,03
458,201903,INDIANA,FLYING LEVEL AT 15;500 AND 220 KNOTS (GROUNDSPEED); BOTH PILOTS OBSERVED A BLACK OBJECT WITH A SMALL RED PAYLOAD HANGING BELOW. THE OBJECT WAS IN SIGHT FOR ONLY A COUPLE SECONDS BEFORE IT WENT ABOVE OUR RIGHT WING WITH ABOUT 10 FEET OF CLEARANCE. IT IS UNCLEAR IF IT WAS A DRONE OR BALLOON OF SOME TYPE; BUT IT APPEARED TO BE MAINTAINING ALTITUDE. THE OBJECT WAS REPORTED TO ATC.,Captain reported sighting an object (either a drone or balloon) close by his aircraft while flying at 15;500 feet.,2019,03
459,201903,LOUISIANA,AFTER TAKEOFF FROM ZZZ NOTICED A DRONE HOVERING AT ABOUT 1;200 FEET AND ABOUT ONE HALF MILE LEFT OF THE DEPARTURE PATH. THE DRONE WAS NOT A FACTOR FOR THE AIRCRAFT. I INFORMED THE TOWER OF THE DRONE.,B737-800 pilot reported a UAV in the vicinity of the airport during takeoff.,2019,03
460,201903,MASSACHUSETTS,WE WERE AT 1;800 FEET ON A WIDE RIGHT BASE FOR RUNWAY 23 AT BED WHEN WE HAD A NEAR MIDAIR WITH A DRONE. THE DRONE WAS ABOUT 1;750 FEET AND WITHIN SEVERAL HUNDRED FEET POSSIBLY UP TO 1;000 FEET HORIZONTALLY AWAY FROM US. THE DRONE WAS BLACK WITH EITHER ORANGE OR RED BLADES. IT HAD AT LEAST TWO BLADES BUT POSSIBLY MORE. IT WAS ROUGHLY 30 INCHES LONG AND 8 INCHES HIGH. I PRESSED THE IDENT BUTTON AND IMMEDIATELY REPORTED IT TO TOWER. UPON LANDING SUCCESSFULLY; GROUND ASKED FOR MORE INFORMATION (COLOR; SIZE; AND MY CONTACT INFORMATION).,PC-12 Captain reported an airborne conflict with a UAV on initial approach to BED.,2019,03
461,201903,NEW JERSEY,UPON OUR DESCENT INTO EWR; WE HAD JUST CROSSED OVER THE NEW JERSEY SHORELINE AND WERE APPROXIMATELY 10 MILES NORTH OF MCGUIRE AFB AT 6;000 FEET. AT THAT TIME I NOTICED A METALLIC GLINT AT ABOUT OUR 1 O'CLOCK POSITION. I ASKED THE FIRST OFFICER IF HE SAW IT AS WELL; AND HE SAID HE DID. AT 250 KIAS; IT CLOSED ON US FAIRLY QUICKLY BUT IT KEPT GLINTING IN THE SUN SO WE WERE ABLE TO TRACK IT. AS WE APPROACHED IT; IT SEEMED TO LOOK LIKE A SMALL BALLOON; BUT AS IT WENT DOWN THE FIRST OFFICER'S SIDE; HE SAID IT WAS A 2-3 FOOT IN DIAMETER DRONE. IT PASSED ABOUT 300 FEET OR SO TO OUR RIGHT HEADED EAST AND ABOUT 300-500 FEET BELOW US. WE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO ATC SO THAT THEY COULD MAKE THE POSITION. NO OTHER AIRCRAFT MENTIONED SEEING THIS OBJECT ANYWHERE IN OUR AREA. THE REST OF THE FLIGHT WAS COMPLETED WITHOUT INCIDENT.,B737 Captain reported a close encounter with a UAV while in descent for landing at EWR.,2019,03
462,201903,NEW JERSEY,ON EXTENDED DOWNWIND WHILE BEING VECTORED FOR AN ILS 22L (~030 HEADING) AT 6;000 FEET MSL AND 250 KIAS; WE ENCOUNTERED A DRONE SIGHTING. THE DRONE WAS FLYING ON A RECIPROCAL HEADING APPROXIMATELY CO-ALTITUDE. THE CLOSEST POINT OF APPROACH WAS APPROXIMATELY 2;000 FEET. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS REQUIRED OR TAKEN. THERE WERE NO TCAS WARNINGS AS WE WEREN'T IN A SITUATION THAT WOULD TRIGGER A TCAS EVENT. WE REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO ATC. THE REST OF THE APPROACH AND LANDING WERE UNEVENTFUL.,Air carrier First Officer reported an airborne conflict with a UAV while being vectored on downwind for an ILS 22L at Newark.,2019,03
463,201903,NEW JERSEY,5 MILES SOUTHWEST OF EWR A DRONE WAS IN PROXIMITY OF OUR AIRCRAFT AT 6;000 FEET.,Air carrier First Officer reported an airborne conflict with a UAV at 6;000 feet while on downwind for Runway 22L at EWR.,2019,03
464,201903,NEW JERSEY,WHILE BEING VECTORED BY NY APPROACH CONTROL IN THE VICINITY OF MORRISTOWN AIRPORT AT 6;000 FEET MSL MY TWO FIRST OFFICERS AND I NOTICED WHAT WE ALL THOUGHT WERE BALLOONS BUT TURNED OUT TO BE A UAS (DRONE) WHICH PASSED OFF OUR RIGHT WING BY LESS THAN 500 FEET. I ESTIMATED THE ACTUAL DISTANCE TO BE CLOSER TO +/- 200 FEET. WE WERE JUST BEING HANDED OFF TO ANOTHER CONTROLLER FREQUENCY 120.15 TO WHOM WE REPORTED THE SIGHTING. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN. [FLIGHT DUTY MANAGER] BRIEFED VIA TELEPHONE AFTER THE FLIGHT.,Air carrier Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV while on approach in NY area.,2019,03
465,201903,NEW YORK,DEPARTED RUNWAY 13 LGA. LGA DEPARTURE WHITESTONE CLIMB. IN THE TURN TO 040 HEADING AND CLIMBING THROUGH 3;800 FEET A DRONE WENT BY VERY QUICKLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT SLIGHTLY ABOVE US. IT PASSED WITHIN ABOUT 100 FEET.,A321 Captain reported encountering a UAV after departing LGA.,2019,03
466,201903,NEW YORK,AIRCRAFT X A UAV REMOTE PILOTED AIRCRAFT WITH AIRCRAFT Z FOR ESCORT. REQUESTED TO DESCEND TO 2;000 FEET DUE TO WEATHER THROUGHOUT THE AIRSPACE. THERE WERE MULTIPLE SQUALLS OF SNOW THAT HAD AFFECTED ALL VFR AIRCRAFT DURING THE ENTIRE SHIFT AND THERE WAS AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT OF VFR CALL UP ACTIVITY FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. AFTER DESCENDING THE UAV TO 2;000 FEET THERE WAS A COORDINATION TO COMBINE THE OPERATION IN WHICH I TOOK CONTROL OF THE ENTIRE AIRSPACE. AFTER THE COORDINATION; I HAD MULTIPLE VFR CALL UPS FOR VFR FLIGHT FOLLOWING. ONE OF THE AIRCRAFT WERE FLYING DIRECTLY INTO A SNOW SQUALL WHICH I FELT NEEDED TO BE RESOLVED. WHILE THIS SITUATION WAS BEING RESOLVED THERE WAS A POSITION RELIEF BRIEFING ABOUT TO BEGIN WHICH FURTHER DREW MY ATTENTION AWAY FROM THE UAV. ADDITIONALLY; AIRCRAFT Y A [COMMERCIAL FIXED WING] DEPARTED OFF OF SYRACUSE WAS ISSUED A HEADING AND CLIMB TO 10;000 FEET. THERE WAS A CORRECT READBACK FROM THE PILOT ON BOTH THE HEADING AND ALTITUDE. THE AIRCRAFT CLIMBED THROUGH 10;000 FEET AND WAS INSTRUCTED TO MAINTAIN PRESENT ALTITUDE AT 11;000 AND WAS GIVEN A PILOT DEVIATION. DURING THIS TIME THE UAV HAD ENTERED AN MVA OF 2;700 FEET WHILE BEING LEVEL AT 2;000 FEET. I ISSUED A CLIMB TO THE UAV TO 3;000 FEET SOON AFTER. KEEP THE OPERATION DE-COMBINED.,Syracuse TRACON Controller reported a UAV that was below the MVA that had to be climbed and an air carrier aircraft that busted their altitude clearance.,2019,03
467,201903,PENNSYLVANIA,ARRIVED AT THE LOSS LOCATION AND WAS IN A HURRY TO GET OUT OF THE EXTREME COLD TEMPERATURES. DID NOT ADEQUATELY CHECK AIRSPACE AT THE LOCATION AND FLEW WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION. AIRSPACE VIOLATION WAS DISCOVERED IN MY COMPANY'S MONTHLY FLIGHT REVIEWS AND HAS BEEN DISCUSSED WITH ME FOR CORRECTIVE MEASURES. WILL FILE A FLIGHT PLAN NEXT TIME I AM IN A LAANC READY AIRSPACE.,DJI Phantom UAV operator reported inadvertently operating in PIT Class B airspace without clearance.,2019,03
468,201903,VIRGINIA,ON FINAL APPROACH SEGMENT OF LDA Z APPROACH TO RUNWAY 6 AT ROA; A DRONE WAS SPOTTED BY SAFETY PILOT. THE DRONE WAS AT 2 O'CLOCK POSITION AND SAME ALTITUDE WHICH WAS 200 FEET AGL. THE DRONE APPEARED TO BE FLYING IN SAME DIRECTION OR TOWARD AIRCRAFT. EVASIVE TURN AWAY FROM DRONE WAS INITIATED BUT ONLY A MINOR CHANGE IN COURSE WAS POSSIBLE IN THE BRIEF TIME AVAILABLE. THE DRONE CAME WITHIN 1;500 FEET OF AIRCRAFT. LANDING WAS COMPLETED AND ROANOKE TOWER WAS ADVISED OF NEAR MISS.,Small aircraft pilot reported an airborne conflict with a UAV on final approach to ROA.,2019,03
469,201904,ARIZONA,THE PURPOSE OF THIS REPORT IS TO REPORT A LAANC PORTAL THAT IS NOT OPERATING PROPERLY WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO A POSSIBLE AIRSPACE INCURSION BY OUR UAS.AT LOCATION  NUMBER 1 (030- DEGREES AT 2.0 NM FROM PXR VOR); THE PIC REQUESTED A LAANC AIRSPACE WAIVER THROUGH THE AIRMAP PROGRAM. ON THE 'FLIGHT BRIEFING' SCREEN THERE WAS AN AMBER BANNER THAT STATED 'AUTHORIZATION UPON SUBMISSION' NOTICE. THE PIC THEN PRESSED THE BLUE 'SUBMIT FLIGHT' BUTTON AND A SCREEN BALLOON APPEARED STATING 'SUCCESS - YOUR FLIGHT PLAN HAS BEEN SUBMITTED'. THE AIRMAP PROGRAM THEN DISPLAYED A MAP SCREEN AND A FLIGHT TIME BANNER APPEARED WITH A CLOCK RUNNING JUST ABOVE A BOTTOM BLUE BANNER LABELED 'END FLIGHT'. WE THEN FLEW TWICE AT THIS LOCATION FOR A TOTAL OF 23 MINUTES.WE REPEATED THIS PROCESS AT A LOCATION NUMBER 2: TEMPE TOWN LAKE MARINA LOCATED AT 078 DEGREES AT 1.9 NM FROM THE PXR VOR. WE FLEW AT LOCATION NUMBER 2 TWICE; TOTALING 15 MINUTES.WHILE THE PIC WAS OPERATING THE DRONE; I WAS AUDITING THE FLIGHT BY LOOKING AT AIRMAP ON MY PHONE AND DID NOT SEE THE FLIGHT DISPLAYED.I ALERTED THE PIC AND HE IMMEDIATELY TERMINATED THE FLIGHT. WE TRIED SEVERAL TIMES TO SUBMIT NEW FLIGHTS ON THE PIC'S PHONE; AND ON MY PHONE; WITH THE SAME RESULTS: AIRMAP PROCESSED THE WAIVER REQUESTS; DISPLAYED NORMAL INDICATIONS THAT THE WAIVER WOULD BE ISSUED; AND THEN STARTED THE FLIGHT TIMER. HOWEVER; WHEN SELECTING THE FLIGHT PLAN DETAILS FOR PREVIOUS FLIGHTS; A RED WAIVER NOT APPROVED BANNER BECAME VISIBLE EVEN THOUGH NORMAL SCREENS APPEARED WHEN WAIVERS WERE APPROVED AND THE FLIGHT TIMER WAS RUNNING.AT THIS POINT; I CONTACTED A PERSON THAT IS INVOLVED IN THE LOCAL AEROSCOPE SECURITY NETWORK AND HE ADVISED ME TO USE A DIFFERENT LAANC PROVIDER.WE RELOCATED TO LOCATION NUMBER 3: 076 DEGREES AT 1.5 NM FROM PXR VOR AND USED THE SKYWARD PORTAL. WE IMMEDIATELY RECEIVED AUTHORIZATION AND A WAIVER NUMBER AT THIS LOCATION; EVEN THOUGH IT WAS A [FEW] MILES CLOSER TO PHX.WE SUSPECT THAT ALL FOUR FLIGHTS AT LOCATIONS NUMBER 1 AND NUMBER 2 MAY HAVE BEEN FLOWN WITHOUT FAA APPROVAL.THEREFORE; OUR UAS OPERATIONS MANUAL WILL BE AMENDED TO REQUIRE THE FAA WAIVER AUTHORIZATION NUMBER BE RECORDED ON OUR FLIGHT MANIFEST PRIOR TO TAKEOFF.ADDITIONALLY; WE HAVE CONTACTED AIRMAP TO REPAIR THEIR IPHONE APP.,UAV operator reported a possible airspace incursion occurred in the vicinity of PXR.,2019,04
470,201904,GEORGIA,PASSING ENSLL WHILE LEVEL AT 12;000 FEET ON THE HOBTT2 ARRIVAL INTO ATL; I OBSERVED AN OBJECT APPEARING TO BE A CONSUMER TYPE DRONE PASS OFF THE RIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT. I ESTIMATED THAT THE OBJECT WAS APPROXIMATELY TWO (2) MILES AWAY; AND APPROXIMATELY 1;000 FEET BELOW OUR ALTITUDE. THE OBJECT WAS REFLECTING THE SUN AND WAS HARD TO DISTINGUISH ANY IDENTIFYING FEATURES. I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED ATC; APPROACH; WHO ADVISED THE AIRCRAFT BEHIND US. AN AIRCRAFT BEHIND US ALSO SPOTTED THE OBJECT; CONCURRED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE A DRONE; AND ALSO NOTED THAT IT APPEARED TO BE TRAVELING SOUTHBOUND. NEAR COLLISION WITH OBJECT APPEARING TO BE A DRONE; INSUFFICIENT TIME TO REACT.,CRJ-900 flight crew reported an airborne conflict with a drone on descent to landing at ATL airport.,2019,04
471,201904,MASSACHUSETTS,DRONE 3;300 FEET ABEAM COHAS ILS 33L BOS WITHIN A MILE; ATC [WAS] NOTIFIED.,A320 Captain reported UAV less than 1 mile abeam the ILS.,2019,04
472,201904,NEW HAMPSHIRE,AN ADJACENT CENTER SECTOR GIVES POINT OUTS TO MY SECTOR ON A REGULAR BASIS ON AIRCRAFT THAT HEAD SOUTHBOUND. THERE IS MILITARY AIRSPACE THAT WAS ACTIVE FROM 18000 TO 23000 FEET. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY ARE AWARE OF THIS AIRSPACE; HELPED DESIGN THE AIRSPACE; AND KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING ACTIVE AND INACTIVE. SO; WHEN I RECEIVED A POINT OUT ON AIRCRAFT X; I ACCEPTED THE AUTOMATED POINT OUT AND CONTINUED ON WITH MY OWN TRAFFIC. A FEW MOMENTS LATER; I NOTICED AIRCRAFT X HAD ENTERED THE SOUTHWESTERN CORNER OF MILITARY RESTRICTED AIRSPACE AT 18000 FEET. THIS IS A VIOLATION OF MILITARY AIRSPACE AND AN UNSAFE SITUATION; SINCE THERE WAS A DRONE CURRENTLY OPERATING IN THE MILITARY AIRSPACE.,A Center Controller observed an aircraft entering military restricted airspace which was active wih a drone flight.,2019,04
473,201904,NEW JERSEY,AFTER ARRIVING AT THE GATE; AN AIR MARSHAL INFORMED ME HE SAW A DRONE JUST OFF THE LEFT WINGTIP ON SHORT FINAL TO [RUNWAY] 4R EWR.   IT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH FOR HIM TO SEE THE PROPELLER BLADES ON THE DRONE. HE OBSERVED IT ABEAM THE OIL REFINERY ON SHORT FINAL TO [RUNWAY] 4R AND GAVE ME [AN APPROXIMATE] TIME. I WOULD SAY IT WAS INSIDE 1;000 FEET ALTITUDE. NONE OF THE PILOTS SAW A DRONE; BUT I DECIDED TO REPORT THIS AS THE AIR MARSHAL IS A RELIABLE SOURCE. I NOTIFIED ONE OF OUR PILOT REPS IN THE EWR RAMP TOWER; AND WAS GIVEN THE PHONE NUMBER TO CALL EWR CONTROL TOWER TO INFORM THEM. THE DRONE DID NOT HIT THE AIRCRAFT.,B767 Captain reported a UAV; observed by a sky marshal from the passenger cabin; less than 1;000 feet horizontal.,2019,04
474,201904,NEW JERSEY,WHILE ON A DOGLEG BASE TO FINAL RUNWAY 22L INTO EWR; MY FIRST OFFICER REPORTED THAT WE HAD BARELY MISSED COLLIDING WITH A DRONE. WE WERE 5 MILES WEST OF FINAL AT 3;000 FEET WHEN A WHITE DRONE WITH SOME RED STRIPING CAME WITHIN A COUPLE HUNDRED FEET WITH US. WE BELIEVE IT WAS AT OUR ALTITUDE BUT A COUPLE HUNDRED FEET SOUTH OF OUR COURSE. WE REPORTED IT TO ATC AND CONTINUED OUR LANDING WITHOUT INCIDENT.,A320 flight crew reported a near mid air collision with a drone during approach to landing.,2019,04
475,201904,NEW YORK,WE WERE ON A LEFT DOWNWIND TO RWY 22 … ABOUT ABEAM GREKO AT 4;000 MSL. THE FIRST OFFICER AND JUMPSEATER REPORTED SEEING A YELLOW AND WHITE DRONE; ABOUT 2 FEET SQUARE; PASS OFF THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT AT APPROXIMATELY 3;900 MSL. WE REPORTED IT TO APPROACH CONTROL.,Flight crew observed a drone pass off the right side of the airplane during approach to landing.,2019,04
476,201904,NEW YORK,DURING A SUAS FLIGHT WITH MY MAVIC 2 PRO; I ACCIDENTALLY FLEW IN TO THE EDGE OF ALB'S CLASS C AIRSPACE. HAVING RECENTLY SWITCHED TO A NEW AIRCRAFT AND FLIGHT CONTROLS; MY TYPICAL PRE-FLIGHT TOOLING WAS NOT AVAILABLE ON THE NEW PLATFORM AND LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THE PLATFORM AND INCORRECT MEMORY OF THE LOCAL BOUNDARIES RESULTED IN AN INCURSION OF NO MORE THAN 100 YARDS OR SO IN TO ALB'S AIRSPACE.I MIS-REMEMBERED THE BOUNDARIES AS FALLING ON THE FAR SIDE OF STARBUCK ISLAND WHEN IN REALITY IT WAS ON THE NEAR SIDE TO MY TAKE OFF/LANDING POINT. MY NEW DJI SMART CONTROLLER DID NOT PROVIDE WARNINGS IN A FORMAT I WAS FAMILIAR WITH AND INTEGRATION ON CONTROLLER WITH AIRMAP AND OTHER LAANC BASED SYSTEMS IS CURRENTLY NOT FUNCTIONAL.MY INITIAL FLIGHT PLAN DID NOT INCLUDE A PATH THAT WOULD HAVE FLOWN IN TO ALB'S AIRSPACE; HOWEVER; UNEXPECTED WIND CONDITIONS ON SITE CAUSED MY PATH OUT TO BE UNSAFE TO RETURN ON DUE TO HAVING TO FLY UNDER A BRIDGE STRUCTURE. I DECIDED TO APPROACH OVER LAND ABOVE THE EMPTY CONSTRUCTION SITE ON THE ISLAND AS THE SAFEST COURSE OF ACTION WITHOUT REMEMBERING THAT THIS FLIGHT PATH WOULD ENTER IN TO ALB CLASS C AIRSPACE.THE INTRUSION WAS DISCOVERED POST FLIGHT DURING A REVIEW THAT I UNDERTOOK DUE TO LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN MY OWN MEMORY OF THE BOUNDARIES. DURING THIS REVIEW; I DISCOVERED THE ERROR.AS A CORRECTIVE ACTION; I PLAN TO REVIEW CHARTS PRIOR TO A FLIGHT WHEN IN NEAR PROXIMITY TO CONTROLLED AIRSPACE EVEN IF MY INITIAL PLAN IS TO STAY WITHIN A KNOWN AREA OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROLLED AIRSPACE.A BROADER CORRECTIVE ACTION WOULD BE TO ENCOURAGE MORE CONSISTENCY AND UPTAKE OF LAANC AND THE UAS FACILITIES DIRECTORY AS THE STANDARD MAPPING SYSTEM IN SUAS CONTROL SYSTEMS. THE POORLY IMPLEMENTED MAPS IN DJI'S GO APP WAS A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE INCIDENT AND SUCH AN INCIDENT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE FLYING UNDER AIRMAP OR A SIMILAR PROGRAM WHICH PROVIDES MORE ACCURATE CHARTING; HOWEVER; SUCH APPS DO NOT CURRENTLY WORK WITH DJI'S SMART CONTROLLER.ESTABLISHED FAA REGULATIONS HELPED ENSURE THAT THE INCIDENT RESOLVED WELL. FLYING WITHIN VISUAL LINE OF SITE AND WITH A SUFFICIENTLY HIGH CLOUD CEILING ALLOWED FOR THE AIRSPACE TO BE EASILY MONITORED LOCALLY DURING THE EVENT.,DJI UAV operator reported an inadvertent intrusion into ALB Class C airspace.,2019,04
477,201904,NEW YORK,FLYING ON A IFR FLIGHT PLAN ON V229 ABOUT 17NM NORTHEAST OF JFK; I HAD A NEAR MISS WITH A QUAD-COPTER STYLE DRONE WHICH SEEMED TO BY FLYING A PARALLEL COURSE ON THE AIRWAY ABOUT 200 FEET BELOW ME. WE PASSED VERY QUICKLY BUT IT WAS CLEARLY A DRONE AND IT WASN'T ALL WHITE; HAD SOME COLORING. I REPORTED IT TO NY APPROACH CONTROL AND THEY THANKED ME FOR THE REPORT. SECOND TIME IN 2 1/2 YEARS I'VE HAD A NEAR MISS WITH A DRONE IN THE NY AREA.,SR22 pilot reported a NMAC with a drone.,2019,04
478,201904,NORTH CAROLINA,WHILE ON A VISUAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 23R AT RDU; MYSELF AND THE CAPTAIN WITNESSED A DRONE HOVERING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE. THE EVENT OCCURRED ON SHORT FINAL; APPROXIMATELY 400 FEET AGL LESS THAN 1 MILE TO TOUCH DOWN. I NOTICED THE OBJECT START AT THE 11 TO 12 O'CLOCK POSITION AND SHIFT TO OUR LEFT AND PASS OFF THE LEFT SIDE. WE REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO ATC WHO ADVISED OTHER AIRCRAFT AND NOTIFIED IN TRAIL AIRCRAFT ON FINAL. NO DEVIATION OR EVASIVE ACTION WAS REQUIRED. POST FLIGHT WALK AROUND SHOWED NO SIGNS OF IMPACT WITH THE OBJECT. FLIGHT LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT RDU TOWER AND APPROACH CONTROL COORDINATED WITH LOCAL AUTHORITIES.,EMB-175 First Officer reported observing a UAV near their course while on short final.,2019,04
479,201905,CALIFORNIA,MY STUDENT AND I HAD A NEAR MISS WITH A WHITE FLYING WING TYPE DRONE NEAR THE RIVERSIDE AUTO CENTER AT AN ALTITUDE OF 2;400 MSL. MY STUDENT WAS AT THE CONTROLS; FLYING INBOUND FROM LAKE MATTHEWS AT 2;400 FT TO SET UP FOR A LEFT BASE ON RUNWAY 27 AS INSTRUCTED BY RIVERSIDE TOWER. MY STUDENT NOTICED AND CALLED OUT THAT AN OBJECT WAS OFF OUR RIGHT (2 O'CLOCK) AND WAS AT THE SAME ALTITUDE. INITIALLY; WE THOUGHT IT WAS A BIRD; BUT AS IS CLOSED IN ON US; WE SAW THAT IT WAS A WHITE FLYING WING TYPE DRONE ABOUT 4 FEET WIDE [AND] 100 FEET AWAY TRAVELING WEST BOUND AT OUR ALTITUDE. IT DID NOT DEVIATE ITS COURSE; I TOOK [OVER] CONTROLS AND ALTERED COURSE TO THE LEFT. WE CONTINUED ON OUR BASE LEG AND REPORTED THE ISSUE TO TOWER AND LANDED WITHOUT ISSUE.,Flight Instructor reported a near miss with a drone while on an instructional flight at an altitude of 2;400 feet.,2019,05
480,201905,CALIFORNIA,WHILE WORKING LOCAL CONTROL; I WAS ALREADY WORKING A MODERATE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC WITH HIGH COMPLEXITY WHEN A LARGE UAS WAS OBSERVED AND COMMENTED ON BY THE GROUND CONTROLLER. WHAT APPEARED TO BE A LARGER QUAD-COPTER OF LARGE ENOUGH SIZE TO DELIVER PACKAGES OPERATING A GUESSTIMATED 1 TO 1.5 NM SE PALO ALTO UP TO AN ESTIMATED 1;500 FEET. I TRIED TO BRIEF AIRCRAFT AND ADJACENT FACILITIES OF THE UAS WHILE OTHERS CALLED THE POLICE DEPARTMENT. I HAD BEEN FORCED TO WORK A LOT OF TRAFFIC ON THE SOUTH SIDE BECAUSE MOFFETT DENIED EXTENSIONS ON THE NORTH SIDE. WITH THE OBSERVED UAS ACTIVITY ON THE SOUTH SIDE THE CIC TRIED TO GET NORTH EXTENSIONS TO BE AWAY FROM THE UAS ACTIVITY AND MOFFETT DENIED THE REQUEST WITHOUT CITING AN OPERATIONAL NEED FOR THE AIRSPACE. THIS RESULTED IN MORE AIRCRAFT REMAINING IN THE SOUTH PATTERN AND INCREASED WORKLOAD IN MY PART TO ISSUE ADDITIONAL ADVISORIES REGARDING UAS ACTIVITY DUE TO THE TRAFFIC BEING FORCED TO FLY IN CLOSER PROXIMITY TO IT; IN ADDITION TO THE COMPLEX AIRSPACE ARRANGEMENT. THIS IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF WHY THE AIRSPACE BETWEEN PALO ALTO AND MOFFETT FIELD NEEDS TO BE REDESIGNED. HAVING TO MAKE AIRCRAFT FLY CLOSER TO UNCOORDINATED UAS ACTIVITY DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO SAFELY AND EFFICIENTLY MOVING AIRCRAFT THROUGH THE NAS. I HAVE PREVIOUSLY FILED A REPORT ABOUT PALO ALTO NEEDING MORE AIRSPACE WHILE STILL BEING SENSITIVE TO MOFFETT OPERATIONS. THIS IS JUST ONE MORE EXAMPLE OF WHY SUCH A CHANGE IS NECESSARY.,ATC Controller reported an example why this particular airspace needs possible redesign and a UAS that was violating the airspace.,2019,05
481,201905,COLORADO,DESCENDING INTO BJC; I ENCOUNTERED A SINGLE REMOTE DRONE AT MY ALTITUDE OFF MY LEFT WING. REPORTED TO BJC TOWER IMMEDIATELY SINCE I WAS ALREADY IN CONTACT WITH THE FOR ARRIVAL. THIS WAS A SILVER & BLACK DRONE.,BE35 pilot reported a NMAC with UAV during arrival at this airport.,2019,05
482,201905,FLORIDA,I WAS ON DESCENT INTO GAINESVILLE ON FINAL FOR RUNWAY 5; I WAS APPROXIMATELY 400 FEET ABOVE THE GROUND AND NOTICED WHAT COULD'VE BEEN A DRONE PASS WITHIN ABOUT 300 FEET OF MY LEFT WING. AT THE TIME; I WAS UNDER A VERY HIGH TASK LOAD BECAUSE I WAS ON SHORT FINAL PREPARING TO LAND IN AN AIRCRAFT THAT IS STILL VERY NEW TO ME SO I WAS BEING EXTREMELY CAUTIOUS TO ENSURE ALL CHECKLIST ITEMS AND WHAT NOT WERE COMPLETE AND MAINTAINING THE PROPER SPEEDS ALTITUDES AND AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATIONS. WHAT I SAW WAS OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE AND I AM NOT 100% SURE THAT IT WAS A DRONE AND THAT IS WHY I DIDN'T MAKE A REPORT TO ATC. I DIDN'T PUT MUCH THOUGHT INTO IT BECAUSE OF BEING ON SHORT FINAL. I CONTINUED THE APPROACH AND LANDED UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS. DURING THE ROLL OUT; ATC ISSUED NONSTANDARD TAXI DIRECTIONS SO THAT OCCUPIED MY MIND AND I DIDN'T THINK MUCH MORE OF MY ENCOUNTER UNTIL WELL AFTER THE FACT THE NEXT DAY WHEN I WAS TALKING WITH ANOTHER COWORKER ABOUT IT. I WOULD SUGGEST JUST BEING MORE AWARE ON SHORT FINAL AND THAT LOW TO THE GROUND OF ANY OBJECT THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE A HAZARD TO FLIGHT SAFETY AND TO ALERT ATC TO THE ISSUE EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE EXACT OBJECT WAS SO THAT THEY KNEW AND COULD WARN OTHER AIRCRAFT.,SR20 pilot reported NMAC with UAV while on approach.,2019,05
483,201905,FLORIDA,CORPORATE CL-850 DEPARTING PBI RUNWAY 10L SID TBIRD2. FLYING THROUGH 10;000 FEET AT 250 KNOTS; RATE OF CLIMB 1;500 FPM. HEADING 286 OUTBOUND FROM AHABB TO DIAPR. DRONE SIGHTED APPROXIMATELY LESS THAN 100 YARDS AHEAD AT OUR 11 TO 12 O'CLOCK POSITION AND VIEWED PASSING BELOW LESS THAN 100 YARDS BELOW. NOTICEABLE FIGURE OF SQUARE DRONE; NOT A BIRD. PASSED WITHOUT EVASIVE ACTION; ONLY FEW SECONDS OF RECOGNITION. REPORTED SIGHTING TO ATC; ATC COLLECTED INFORMATION AND IN TURN ATC TRANSMITTED INFORMATION TO AIRCRAFT IN VICINITY.,Challenger Captain reported an airborne conflict with a UAV during climb.,2019,05
484,201905,IDAHO,FIRED UP DRONE AND FLEW LOW IN A PARKING LOT AREA; BELOW THE TREE LINE; FOR ABOUT ONE MINUTE NOT EXCEEDING 30 FT. OR SO BEFORE REALIZING DRONE WAS JUST INSIDE THE 5 NM RING FOR ATC CONTACT. LANDED IMMEDIATELY AND POWERED DOWN. FILED THIS REPORT SOON AFTER.,UAV operator reported inadvertantly penetrating airspace without required ATC communication.,2019,05
485,201905,NEW JERSEY,WHILE SITTING ON TAXIWAY A SHORT OF RK THE FIRST OFFICER AND I OBSERVED A ROUGHLY 12' DRONE OVERFLY THE RAMP. THE DRONE APPROACHED FROM THE BALL PARK AND FLEW BETWEEN GATE 1 AND GATE 2. IT WAS AT ROUGHLY 30 FEET. WE ADVISED RAMP OF THE DRONE AND ANOTHER AIRCRAFT ON FREQUENCY CONFIRMED THAT THEY ALSO HAD A VISUAL ON THE DRONE. UPON CONTACT WITH GROUND CONTROL WE ALSO ADVISED THEM OF THE DRONE SIGHTING.,B737 Captain reported sighting a small UAV flying at approximately 30 feet over adjacent taxiways at EWR.,2019,05
486,201905,NEW JERSEY,WE WERE ON APPROACH TO RWY 04R; LOOKING FOR HELICOPTER TRAFFIC. PASSING THRU 1;800 FEET; WE SAW A BLACK DOT; MORE CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE LEFT RUNWAY. AS WE GOT CLOSER; WE OBSERVED A BLACK AND RED DRONE; MAYBE 2 FEET SQUARE. IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING OVER FINAL FOR [RUNWAY] 04L; AND ANOTHER PLANE LANDING ON THAT RUNWAY CALLED IT OUT FIRST. AFTER LANDING; THE PORT AUTHORITY POLICE CAME ON BOARD; AND WE MADE A VERBAL REPORT WITH THEM. SOMEONE UNKNOWN WAS FLYING A DRONE WHERE THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN. I AM UNSURE HOW TO CONTROL THIS TYPE OF EVENT.,Airline Captain reported an encounter with a drone while on approach to Newark airport.,2019,05
487,201905,NEW YORK,DURING THE CRUISE PHASE ON A FLIGHT FROM ON A HEADING OF 315 DEGREES; APPROXIMATELY 2MI. SW OF ITH AT 4;500 MSL; I (PIC) AND THE PASSENGER IN THE RIGHT FRONT SEAT SPOTTED WHAT APPEARED TO BE TRAFFIC AT APPROXIMATELY THE SAME ALTITUDE APPEARING TO BE TURNING AWAY; I MENTALLY ESTIMATED AT 3-4 MILES AWAY. HOWEVER; IT WAS QUICKLY APPARENT THIS WAS NOT FIXED WING OR ROTOR TRAFFIC AFTER THE OBJECT QUICKLY REVERSED COURSE TO A SOUTHEASTERLY HEADING AND WAS NOW CLOSING THE SEPARATION BETWEEN US; CLEARLY NOW WITHIN SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET NOT 3-4 AS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED. WITHIN 15 SECONDS FROM SPOTTING THE TRAFFIC; IT WAS WITHIN 300 FEET OF OUR AIRCRAFT AND PASSED OFF THE PORT SIDE WITHIN 100 FEET AND APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET BELOW. AS IT PASSED; IT BECAME OBVIOUS THE TRAFFIC INITIALLY SPOTTED WAS A UAV; BLACK IN COLOR WITH A RED COMPONENT. WE WOULD ESTIMATE THE SIZE AS 2'X 2'. A REPORT WAS FILED WITH THE APPROACH CONTROLLER.,Piper Cherokee PIC reported encountering a drone while in cruise flight at 4;500 feet just north of Ithaca; NY.,2019,05
488,201906,ARIZONA,WHILE DESCENDING ON A RADAR VECTOR FROM THE NORTH; LEFT BASE; RUNWAY 08; THE FIRST OFFICER AND I WITNESSED A DRONE AIRCRAFT PASSING OFF THE LEFT WING OF THE AIRCRAFT. WE WERE AT 5;800M (APPROXIMATELY 3;700 FEET AGL). IT WAS DIFFICULT TO ASCERTAIN THE DIRECTION OF FLIGHT OR WHETHER IT WAS CLIMBING OR DESCENDING. BECAUSE THERE WERE NO REFERENCES/PERSPECTIVE; IT WAS ALSO DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT ITS SIZE. I BELIEVE IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 100 TO 200 FEET AWAY BASED ON THE DRONES I'VE SEEN IN THE PAST; BUT THAT IS JUST A GUESS. BOTH OF US BELIEVE IT HAD AT LEAST TWO PROPELLERS AS THE PYLONS WERE RECOGNIZABLE AS WE FLEW BY. THE VEHICLE WAS WHITE AND WAS SQUARE SHAPED. I HAD IT IN VIEW AS WE PASSED BY FROM THE 10 TO 8 O'CLOCK POSITION. PHOENIX APPROACH WAS NOTIFIED AS WE PASSED THE DRONE--LOCATION AND ALTITUDE WERE PROVIDED.,B-737 Captain reported encountering a drone while being vectored for landing at PHX.,2019,06
489,201906,ARIZONA,WE REPORTED A DRONE AT CO-ALTITUDE (5;800 FEET) WHILE ON AN EIGHT-MILE LEFT BASE LEG TO RUNWAY 8 IN PHX. IT WAS HEADED OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND WITHIN 200 FEET OR SO. I REPORTED IT TO ATC; WHO SAID THEY WOULD 'SEND SOMEONE OUT THERE.',B-737 First Officer reported encountering a drone while being vectored for landing at PHX.,2019,06
490,201906,CALIFORNIA,WE WERE DEPARTING TORRANCE; CALIFORNIA IN CONTACT WITH SOCAL DEPARTURE. WE WERE CLEARED DIRECT TO SEAL BEACH VOR AND CLIMBING THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 5;000 FEET WHEN I CAUGHT MOVEMENT IN MY PERIPHERAL VISION ABOUT THE 10 O'CLOCK POSITION. BY THE TIME I WAS ABLE TO LOOK DIRECTLY AT THE OBJECT; IT PASSED APPROXIMATELY 30 TO 50 FEET OFF OF OUR LEFT WING TIP. I INITIALLY THOUGHT IT WAS A BIRD UNTIL THE SUN LIGHT REFLECTED OFF THE OBJECT; GIVING THE APPEARANCE OF A MIRRORED OR METALLIC FINISH; THE OBJECT WAS MOVING HORIZONTALLY AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED (MUCH HIGHER THAN A BIRD) LEADING TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT WAS A SMALL DRONE THAT WE NEARLY MISSED COLLIDING WITH. WE REPORTED THE OCCURRENCE WITH ATC AND CONTINUED THE FLIGHT WITH NO FURTHER ISSUES.,PIC reported encountering a drone approaching SLI VOR.,2019,06
491,201906,CALIFORNIA,A DRONE/OBJECT PASSED OVERHEAD OUR POSITION AS WE DESCENDED ON THE GLIDEPATH FOR [RUNWAY] 20R. I SAW THE OBJECT FOR ONLY A FEW SECONDS. WE REPORTED IT TO TOWER AND WERE INTERVIEWED BY THE POLICE. IT WAS ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE US AS WE DESCENDED THROUGH 2;500 FEET ON FINAL APPROACH TO [RUNWAY] 20R.,B737-700 First Officer reported a NMAC with a UAV while on approach.,2019,06
492,201906,CALIFORNIA,APPROXIMATELY ONE MILE NORTH OF LEMON; THE FINAL APPROACH FIX FOR RUNWAY 20R IN SNA; THE FIRST OFFICER (PILOT FLYING) OBSERVED A DRONE PASS ABOUT 100' OVER OUR AIRCRAFT. WE WERE AT 2500' MSL AT THE TIME. WE NOTIFIED ATC AND DISPATCH AS SOON AS POSSIBLE; AND WERE INTERVIEWED AT THE GATE BY TWO DEPUTIES.,B737-700 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAS while on approach to SNA.,2019,06
493,201906,FLORIDA,WE HAD WEATHER FORECAST FOR THE SOUTHEASTERN US. AS THE DAY MOVED ON; THE WEATHER STARTED TO MOVE EASTBOUND AND BUILD; AS FORECAST IN MY PRE-DUTY WEATHER BRIEFING. WARNING AREAS WERE ACTIVE. ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THINGS STARTED GETTING PINCHED; I HEARD AT LEAST 3 CONTROLLERS INFORM THE SUPERVISOR THAT IF WE DID NOT GET THE WARNING AREA RELEASED; WE WERE GOING TO NEED ANOTHER PLAN. THE SUPERVISOR CALLED TMU (TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT UNIT) AND RELAYED THEM THIS INFORMATION AND REQUESTED THE WARNING AREA TO BE RECALLED. AS TIME MOVED ON; AIRCRAFT STARTED DEVIATING FURTHER AND FURTHER EAST; ZZZ ARRIVALS WERE HAVING TO BE RESTRICTED TO 24000 FEET (LETTER OF AGREEMENT CALLS FOR 34000 FEET) IN ORDER FOR US TO SAFELY RUN DEPARTURES AND ARRIVALS HEAD ON WITH EACH OTHER. STILL MANAGEABLE AT THIS POINT; ALTHOUGH THE LEVEL OF SAFETY WAS SUSPECT. THE MORNING CONTINUED TO ROLL-ON AND THE WEATHER CONTINUED TO MOVE EAST WITH MULTIPLE CONTROLLERS; INCLUDING MYSELF; INFORMING OUR SUPERVISOR THAT THIS PLAN WASN'T GOING TO WORK IN THE NEXT 20 MINUTES. THE RESPONSE HE WAS GIVEN FROM TMU WAS 'I HAVE YOUR REQUEST'. NEXT THING YOU KNOW; AIRCRAFT WERE DEVIATING INTO THE WARNING AREAS. WE HAD AT LEAST 2 GET IN THERE WITH POINT OUTS AND MANAGED TO KEEP MOST OF THEM OUTSIDE THE AIRSPACE WITH SOME PERSUASIVE SUGGESTION. THE WARNING AREA CONTROLLERS BEGAN TO SAY UNABLE TO TAKE HAND OFFS FOR OUR SECTORS. ONE SECTOR HAD AT LEAST ONE AIRCRAFT GET INTO THE WARNING AREA ON AN EMERGENCY SQUAWK. ANOTHER SECTOR HAD MULTIPLE AIRCRAFT REQUESTING DEVIATIONS INTO THE WARNING AREA. THAT SECTOR THEN HAD TO SHUTOFF THE ADJACENT SECTOR FROM ALL DIRECTIONS AND ANOTHER SECTOR SHUT OFF DEPARTURES OUT OF ANOTHER AIRPORT. THE EAST AREA HAD TO HOLD OUR AIRCRAFT AS WELL. TMU DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE A PLAN OR REROUTE ANYONE UNTIL AFTER OUR CONTROLLERS SHUT THE DOOR. MULTIPLE CONTROLLERS HOLDING; MULTIPLE SECTORS SHUT OFF WITH WEATHER; MULTIPLE AIRCRAFT IN THE WARNING AREAS. I WISH I COULD SAY THIS IS AN ISOLATED INCIDENT. HOWEVER; THIS IS ROUTINE AT THIS CENTER. WE CONTINUOUSLY PUSH THE ENVELOPE OF SAFETY JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE EACH TIME. WE'VE BEEN HERE ONCE BEFORE; UNTIL CAR (CORRECTIVE ACTION REPORT) CAME ABOUT. CAR HELPED FOR AWHILE; BUT WE'VE SLOWLY CREPT BACK TO WHERE WE WERE BEFORE IT WAS IMPLEMENTED AS PART OF OUR 7110.65. APPENDIX B IN OUR 7110.65 ADDRESSES THIS VERY TOPIC. IT WAS A DIRECT RESULT OF CAR SOME YEARS AGO. TMU ABSOLUTELY DID NOT COMPLY WITH THIS DIRECTIVE. THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME; AND I'M CERTAIN IT WILL NOT BE THE LAST. WE FREQUENTLY REQUEST THINGS FROM TMU; IT FALLS BY THE WAY SIDE; OR WE'RE TOLD WE DON'T NEED IT; OR WE HAVE YOUR REQUEST. THIS IS NOT SAFE. WE ARE NOT STAFFED APPROPRIATELY TO BE DOING THE JOBS OF TWO AND THREE PEOPLE WITH WEATHER DEVIATIONS AND NO SUPPORT FROM OUR OWN UNIT TASKED WITH PROTECTING US. A PLAN NEEDED TO BE IMPLEMENTED TWO HOURS PRIOR; LIKE OUR OWN FACILITY SOP CALLS FOR. SOMETHING NEEDS TO CHANGE AND PEOPLE NEED TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE.,ZJX Center Controllers reported the Traffic Management Unit refused to provide adequate flow control through their sectors and aircraft were forced to deviate into hot Warning Areas.,2019,06
494,201906,MICHIGAN,WHILE CONDUCTING [LINE CHECK] WITH A RETURN TO WORK FIRST OFFICER; WE HAD A CLOSE ENCOUNTER WITH A DRONE.  WE WERE ON THE DOWN-WIND APPROXIMATELY 5 NM EAST OF DTW BEING VECTORED FOR A VISUAL APPROACH TO [RUNWAY] 21L IN VMC.  WE WERE LEVEL AT 8;000 FEET MSL; SPEED 250 KIAS; WHEN THE FIRST OFFICER OBSERVED A DRONE VERY QUICKLY GO PAST THE RIGHT SIDE (HIS SIDE) OF THE AIRCRAFT AT VERY CLOSE RANGE (WITHIN A HUNDRED OR SO FEET) AND SLIGHTLY BELOW OUR ALTITUDE.  IT APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY 2 FEET IN DIAMETER; ROUGHLY SQUARE SHAPED; AND WAS GREEN AND WHITE IN COLOR.  WE ADVISED ATC AND GAVE BASIC DETAILS OF THE LOCATION; ALTITUDE AND DESCRIPTION.  AFTER ARRIVAL; AND AFTER LEAVING THE AIRCRAFT AND GATE AREA; I RECEIVED A CALL FROM DETROIT AIRPORT OPERATIONS AND RETURNED TO THE GATE AT THEIR REQUEST.  I MET WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AND PROVIDED A DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT AS WELL AS MY PERSONAL INFORMATION; FLIGHT NUMBER; AND AIRCRAFT 'N' NUMBER AT THEIR REQUEST.,Regional jet Captain reported encountering a drone while on downwind for landing at Detroit airport.,2019,06
495,201906,MINNESOTA,UPON DEPARTING FROM DELTA AIRSPACE; TOWER SWITCHED AIRCRAFT X OVER TO DEPARTURE. UPON CLIMBING; DEPARTURE ADVISED AIRCRAFT X TO CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 10;000 FEET. SHORTLY AFTER AIRCRAFT X WAS INSTRUCTED TO CLIMB UP TO FL190; AIRCRAFT X THEN READ BACK THE ALTITUDE OF FL190. IT WAS UNDERSTOOD THAT AIRCRAFT X WAS TO CLIMB AND MAINTAIN FL190. FL190 WAS THEN PROGRAMMED INTO THE AUTOPILOT AFTER THAT CLEARANCE WAS GIVEN. THE INSTRUMENTS WERE CROSSED CHECK; AND AUTOPILOT WAS CONFIRMED FL190 SET. THE AIRCRAFT WAS CORRECTLY CLIMBING AT 105 KNOTS; 500 FPM; FOR FL190. SHORTLY AFTER; DEPARTURE SWITCHED AIRCRAFT X OVER TO CENTER. ON INITIAL CALL; IT WAS COMMUNICATED THAT AIRCRAFT X WAS CLIMBING OUT OF 6;000 FEET FOR FL210 (AS THAT IS WHAT WAS FILED). CENTER THEN REPLIED THAT DEPARTURE HAD GIVEN AIRCRAFT X THE WRONG ALTITUDE AND WAS TO CLIMB AND MAINTAIN FL190. AIRCRAFT X REPLIED AND CONFIRMED FL190. AIRCRAFT X ALSO STATED THAT DEPARTURE HAD GIVEN THE CORRECT ALTITUDE OF FL190; AND THAT IT WAS CLIMBING FOR FL210 (AS THE FLIGHT PLAN WAS FILED FOR FL210). THIS IS WHERE THE COMMUNICATION ERROR BECAME APPARENT. EVEN THOUGH THE AUTOPILOT WAS CONFIRMED SET AT FL190 AND THAT IS WHAT THE PILOT INTENDED ON DOING; THE WAY THE STATEMENT TO CENTER CAME ACROSS MADE THEM THINK OTHERWISE. AFTER THAT STATEMENT; MINNEAPOLIS CENTER GAVE AIRCRAFT X A NUMBER TO CALL. WHEN IN CONTACT WITH CENTER ON THE PHONE THE MAIN CONCERN TO THEM WAS SAFETY OF FLIGHT. AS THE OTHER AIRCRAFT X WAS AT FL200; WHEN THE CALL OF 'CLIMBING THROUGH 6000' FOR FL210' WAS MADE. THE EVENT ENDED WITHOUT AIRCRAFT SEPARATION BEING BROKEN. ACCURACY AND DILIGENCE IN THE PHRASEOLOGY TO ATC IS IMPORTANT. THE AIRCRAFT X SHOULD HAVE INITIALLY COMMUNICATED TO CENTER 'AIRCRAFT X (TAIL NUMBER) CLIMBING OUT OF 6;000 FEET; FOR FL190; EXPECTING FL210'. IT IS UNDERSTOOD THAT THE VERBAL READ BACK NEEDS TO BE FOR THE ALTITUDE CLEARED TO AND NOT THE ALTITUDE EXPECTED BASED ON THE FLIGHT PLAN FILED.,UAV operator reported miscommunication with ATC while drone was inflight.,2019,06
496,201906,NEW JERSEY,ON FINAL APPROACH IN VISUAL CONDITIONS TO RUNWAY 4R AT EWR; THE [RELIEF PILOT] CALLED OUT SIGHTING A DRONE AT OUR 10 O'CLOCK POSITION AT OUR ALTITUDE. I ACQUIRED THE DRONE VISUALLY AND WHILE NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS NECESSARY; I WAS SURPRISED BY HOW CLOSE IT WAS TO US. OUR POSITION WAS A 3 MILE FINAL FOR RUNWAY 4R AT 1;000 [FEET] AGL. I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT THE DRONE WAS ABOUT 500 TO 1000 FT. OFF OUR LEFT WING ON THE EXTENDED RUNWAY CENTERLINE FOR RUNWAY 4L. IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING IN POSITION AND WAS NOT CHANGING ALTITUDE. IT WAS WHITE IN COLOR; AND APPEARED TO HAVE 4 PROPELLERS. WE REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO EWR TOWER. AFTER PARKING; I WAS MET BY TWO AIRPORT POLICE OFFICERS WHO ASKED ME TO DESCRIBE THE SIGHTING FOR THEIR REPORT.,Airline Captain reported sighting a drone 500-1;000 feet away while on visual approach to Newark.,2019,06
497,201906,NEW JERSEY,DURING EXTENDED DOWNWIND VECTORS AT 5;000 MSL ON THE ARRIVAL FOR RWY 22L YESTERDAY; WE EXPERIENCED A TCAS RA THAT RESULTED IN A CLOSE CALL WITH EITHER AN AIRCRAFT OR DRONE. WE WERE IN ALT WHEN WE RECEIVED A 'TRAFFIC; TRAFFIC' TA. ATC CALLED OUT TRAFFIC AHEAD AT 12 O'CLOCK; TYPE AND ALTITUDE UNKNOWN. WE LOOKED FOR THE TRAFFIC. THE AIRCRAFT WAS ON AUTOPILOT AND LEVELED OFF. THE TRAFFIC THEN DISAPPEARED FROM THE SCREEN AND WE THOUGHT WE WERE IN THE CLEAR. APPROXIMATELY 10-15 SECONDS LATER WE RECEIVED AN RA 'CLIMB; CLIMB'. WHEN I LOOKED DOWN AT THE ND (20 MILE RANGE) THE SYMBOLOGY SHOWED A RED TARGET AT -01 DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE AIRPLANE AND TO THE LEFT SIDE OF THE NOSE. I HAVE RECEIVED RAS BEFORE; BUT THIS ONE WAS VERY CLOSE. I IMMEDIATELY DISCONNECTED THE AUTOPILOT; WENT TOGA AND STARTED A CLIMBING RIGHT TURN. WE WERE CONFIGURED AT FLAPS 1. THE FO TOLD ATC 'TCAS RA'. I QUICKLY CAME OUT OF TOGA AND RESTORED NORMAL AUTO FLIGHT WHEN THE 'CLEAR OF CONFLICT' ADVISORY SOUNDED. WE RESUMED THE ARRIVAL AND NO AIRCRAFT PARAMETERS OR LIMITS WERE EXCEEDED. SHORTLY THEREAFTER; WE HEARD [AIR CARRIER] FLIGHT XXXXX ALSO REPORT A TCAS RA.,Airbus 320 captain reported encountering a aircraft or a drone via a TCAS Resolution Advisory warning.,2019,06
498,201906,NEW JERSEY,WHILE GETTING VECTORED FOR AN ILS RUNWAY 22L AT NEWARK WE UNDER FLEW A LARGE QUAD DRONE WHILE LEVEL AT 3000 FEET. OUR HEADING WAS 120 DEGREES. WE WERE ABOUT 5 MILES WEST OF TETERBORO VOR. WE MISSED THE DRONE BY 100 FEET OR LESS. THIS DRONE LOOKED LIKE SOMETHING LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD USE. IT WAS BLACK WITH SILVER STRUTS. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN AS THERE WASN'T ENOUGH TIME AND I SAW WE WERE GOING UNDERNEATH IT. THE FIRST OFFICER DID NOT SEE THE DRONE. INFORMED ATC OF THE INCIDENT. GAVE MORE DETAILS TO THE GROUND CONTROLLER AT EWR. PERSON OPERATING THE DRONE WITHOUT PROPER CLEARANCE AND DID NOT FOLLOW FAA RULES FOR OPERATING DRONES. SUGGEST BETTER SECURITY AND MONITORING DRONE OPERATIONS NEAR AIRPORTS AS WELL AS BETTER TRAINING FOR DRONE OPERATORS.,B767 flight crew reported encountering a UAV while on approach to EWR at 3000 feet.,2019,06
499,201906,NEW YORK,I WAS THE PILOT MONITORING. WE HAD RECEIVED CLEARANCE FOR THE FREEWAY VISUAL APPROACH TO LGA. WHEN APPROACHING DIALS; AT APPROXIMATELY 2650' MSL; WE SAW A FAIRLY LARGE AND BLACK DRONE PASS WITHIN 20' OF OUR RIGHT WING. THE DRONE APPEARED TO BE A DISC SHAPE; OF THE 6+ ENGINE VARIETY; VS 4 ENGINE KIND. I REPORTED THE NEAR MISS WITH NY APPROACH AND ADVISED THEM OF ALTITUDE AND COLOR. NO EVASIVE ACTIONS WERE TAKEN AS IT HAD PASSED US WITHIN A SECOND OR TWO OF US NOTICING. LATER; I RECEIVED A CALL ADVISING THAT THE FEDS WERE INVESTIGATING THE INCIDENT. OBVIOUSLY; THERE WAS NO TRANSPONDER ON THE AIRCRAFT; AND IT WAS SO SMALL IT LIKELY DIDN'T APPEAR ON THE CONTROLLER'S PRIMARY RADAR. SHORT OF BANNING ALL DRONES; I DON'T KNOW WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN DONE TO AVOID THIS TYPE OF ENCOUNTER IN THE FUTURE.,First Officer reported an inflight encounter with a drone while on approach to La Guardia airport.,2019,06
500,201906,NEW YORK,WE WERE DESCENDING FROM 7;000 FEET TO 4;000 FEET PROCEEDING DIRECT TO THE DIALS INTERSECTION. I WAS THE PILOT FLYING THE AIRPLANE. AT APPROXIMATELY 4;500 FT.; THE FIRST OFFICER; POINTED OUT AN OBJECT AT APPROXIMATELY 10 O'CLOCK TO OUR POSITION. IT TOOK ME ABOUT A HALF SECOND TO PROCESS WHAT THE OBJECT WAS. AT FIRST; I THOUGHT THAT IT WAS A MYLAR BALLOON BUT THEN IT LOOKED MORE LIKE TWO SPHERES CONNECTED TOGETHER VERTICALLY. THE OBJECT WAS DARK IN COLOR AND I WOULD APPROXIMATE THE SPHERES TO EACH BE 2 FEET IN DIAMETER. AS THE OBJECT WAS AT ABOUT OUR 9 O'CLOCK POSITION; WE DETERMINED THAT THE OBJECT WAS A UAV. BY THAT TIME; WE WERE ALREADY PASSING THE OBJECT AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO REACT. FROM THE MOMENT OF DETECTION; UNTIL THE OBJECT WAS SAFELY PAST OUR WING WAS APPROXIMATELY 3 SECONDS. I WOULD ESTIMATE THAT OUR LEFT WING CAME WITHIN 200-500 FEET OF THE OBJECT; HOWEVER; I CANNOT BE SURE HOW CLOSE (OR FAR) WE CAME FROM IT DUE TO THE SHORT TIME THAT WE SAW IT. IMMEDIATELY AFTER PASSING THE OBJECT; WE NOTIFIED APPROACH CONTROL OF THE ENCOUNTER.,Captain reported encountering a UAV while in descent for landing to LGA.,2019,06
501,201906,NORTH CAROLINA,THIS PROBLEM AROSE FROM CONFUSING THE AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURER'S GEO-FENCING WITH REQUESTING AUTHORIZATION TO FLY IN CONTROLLED AIRSPACE. AFTER SUCCESSFULLY UNLOCKING THE MANUFACTURER'S GEO-FENCING; I INCORRECTLY ASSUMED THAT I HAD AUTHORIZATION TO FLY IN CLASS C AIRSPACE. THIS AIRSPACE VIOLATION WAS DISCOVERED BY MY MANAGER DURING THE MONTHLY FLIGHT REVIEWS. I NOW KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN UNLOCKING THE GEO-FENCING AND REQUESTING AUTHORIZATION FOR FLIGHT. I WILL NOT TAKE FLIGHTS IN CONTROLLED AIRSPACE UNTIL I HAVE THE FAA CONFIRMATION CODE.,UAV Operator reported entering Class C airspace without authorization.,2019,06
502,201906,PENNSYLVANIA,WHILE IN THE DESCENT BETWEEN 10;000 AND 8;500 FEET CAPTAIN ASKED ME; 'DID YOU SEE THAT?' I LOOKED UP IN TIME TO SEE AN OBJECT GOING BY THE NOSE OF THE AIRPLANE; A FEW FEET ABOVE US AND OPPOSITE DIRECTION. THE OBJECT PASSED US SO QUICKLY I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO REALLY GET A LOOK AT IT. THE CAPTAIN ASKED IF IT WAS A DRONE; I SAID IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN BUT I WASN'T SURE. THE CAPTAIN NOTIFIED ATC THAT WE HAD A DRONE PASS CLOSELY BY US. THE CLOSURE RATE AND SIZE OF THE OBJECT MEANT THAT WAS NOT SUFFICIENT TIME TO REACT IF IT HAD BEEN NECESSARY. LUCKILY THE OBJECT MISSED US. THE FLIGHT CONTINUED WITHOUT FURTHER EVENT.,EMB-145LR first officer reported a NMAC with a possible UAV during descent.,2019,06
503,201906,TEXAS,I WAS DOING A TRAINING FLIGHT WITH MY STUDENT IN THE SOUTH TRAINING AREA OF GPM. THIS IS WHERE WE NORMALLY GO TO CONDUCT VFR TRAINING FLIGHTS WHILE AT 3;500 [FEET] 25 SSW OF GPM; OVER LAKE ALVARADO; EAST SIDE OF I-35. WE WERE DOING STEEP TURNS WHEN I SAW A DRONE ALMOST A SIZE OF A COMPUTER (RED AND WHITE IN COLOR); PASS UNDERNEATH US ABOUT 200 FT. LOW; HALF A MILE OF HORIZONTAL SEPARATION. SINCE WE WERE ALREADY IN A STEEP TURN; WE DIDN'T HAVE TO TAKE ANY EVASIVE ACTION; BUT THAT WAS DEFINITELY A BIT ALARMING. THE AIRCRAFT IS EQUIPPED WITH ADS-B IN/OUT AND ALSO I WAS FLYING WITH A POTABLE ADS-B; WE DIDN'T RECEIVE ANY TRANSPONDER SIGNAL FROM THE DRONE.  THE DRONE WAS ON A NORTH HEADING; AND IF IT HAD CONTINUED THAT WAY (WHICH I DIDN'T SEE AFTER THE COMPLETION OF MY STEEP TURN) HE WOULD HAVE PROBABLY ENDED UP IN DFW CLASS B IN ANOTHER 10 MILES OR SO AT THAT ALTITUDE. WE CALL GPM TOWER; AND REPORTED THE INCIDENT. UPON LANDING AT GPM; GPM TOWER FURTHER ASKED MORE ABOUT THE INCIDENT AND THE REPORT IS BEING FILED.,CFI reported encountering a drone at 3;500 feet altitude while conducting a training flight.,2019,06
504,201906,VIRGINIA,PASSED A DRONE ON A HEADING TO PHF AT 7;500 FEET MSL; A DRONE WAS SIGHTED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY (ABOUT 500 FEET FROM THE AIRCRAFT). IT WAS TRAVELING OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO OUR AIRCRAFT. IT WAS A WHITE QUAD-COPTER. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS REQUIRED. IT WAS REPORTED FOR FUTURE TRAFFIC.,Embraer Captain reported encountering a drone at 7;500 feet in the vicinity of area.,2019,06
505,201906,VIRGINIA,ON APPROACH INTO PHF AT 7;500 FEET MSL; A DRONE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY (ABOUT 500 FEET) FLYING IN THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION TO OUR FLIGHT WAS SIGHTED BY THE CAPTAIN (PILOT MONITORING). IT WAS A WHITE QUADCOPTER. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS REQUIRED AND THE SIGHTING WAS IMMEDIATELY REPORTED TO THE CONTROLLER BY THE CAPTAIN. REPORTED IT TO ATC FOR THEIR INFORMATION AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHER TRAFFIC IN THE AREA.,First Officer reported encountering a drone while on final approach to Newport News airport.,2019,06
506,201906,WISCONSIN,I WAS FLYING A SMALL UAS. DURING THE FLIGHT; THE AIRCRAFT PASSED IN FRONT OF THE SUN AND I LOST VISUAL CONTACT FOR APPROX. 10 SECONDS. AFTERWARDS; I COULD NOT REACQUIRE VISUAL CONTACT. I COULD HEAR THE PROPELLER AND EXECUTED WHAT I ESTIMATED WAS A 180 DEGREE TURN WITH THE THROTTLE AT MID-POSITION TO BRING THE PLANE BACK TO MY LOCATION. AFTER WAITING APPROXIMATELY THE TIME THE PLANE HAD BEEN FLYING AWAY FROM ME; I SCANNED THE LIKELY AREA OF SKY BUT COULD NOT SEE IT. I THEN EXECUTED A 90-DEGREE BANKED TURNS TO PUT THE INCREASE THE VISIBILITY OF THE PLANE (THE PLANE WAS FLYING IN A STABILIZED MODE WITH A ROLL LIMIT OF 90 DEGREES; SO FULL AILERON STICK-DEFLECTION WOULD CAUSE A CONSISTENT 90-DEGREE BANK ANGLE). WHEN I WAS UNABLE TO SEE THE PLANE (I COULD STILL HEAR THE PROPELLER AT THIS POINT) I EXECUTED A SERIES OF TURNS WHILE MONITORING THE RSSI (RECEIVER SIGNAL LEVEL TRANSMITTED FROM THE PLANE BACK TO THE TRANSMITTER) AND TRIED TO FIND A COURSE THAT WOULD INCREASE THE RSSI LEVEL INDICATING THE PLANE WAS FLYING CLOSER. UNFORTUNATELY; THE RSSI TELEMETRY SYSTEM IS NOT VERY ACCURATE AT THIS RANGE AND I WAS UNABLE TO GET A STABLE ENOUGH SIGNAL. AT THIS POINT THE TELEMETRY LINK WAS LOST (THE TRANSMITTED SIGNAL HAS A SUBSTANTIALLY LONGER RANGE). TO MINIMIZE ANY POTENTIAL DAMAGE ON LANDING; I CLOSED THE THROTTLE AND APPLIED FULL BACK ELEVATOR TO SLOW THE FORWARD SPEED AND DESCENT RATE UNTIL I ESTIMATED THE PLANE WOULD HAVE LANDED (APPROXIMATELY ONE MINUTE). THE PRIMARY INITIATION OF THIS EVENT WAS A BRIEF LOSS IN AWARENESS OF THE PLANE'S PATH RELATIVE TO THE SUN. NORMALLY I AVOID FLYING NEAR THE SUN BUT IN THIS CASE I MISJUDGED.,UAV operator reported losing sight of the drone while controlling it in-flight.,2019,06
507,201907,CALIFORNIA,RELIEVED CONTROLLER BRIEFED THAT AIRCRAFT X WAS HOLDING IN GUAM AIRSPACE.  RESET TIMES TO KEEP FROM FLIGHT INFORMATION AUTOMATICALLY COORDINATING WITH TOKYO CENTER.  AIRCRAFT ENTERED ZOA AIRSPACE AND EVENTUALLY TOKYO AIRSPACE WITHOUT CORRECT COORDINATION. A 'HOLD' BUTTON THAT KEEPS CONTROLLER FROM BEING INUNDATED WITH ERROR MESSAGES WOULD HAVE SOLVED PROBLEM.,Oakland Center Controller reported a UAV entered ZOA and Tokyo airspace without proper coordination.,2019,07
508,201907,COLORADO,DEN ARRIVAL VFR DAY WITH MOD BUT STUDY WINDS FROM THE SOUTHWEST. WE BRIEFED ALMOST ONE HOUR PRIOR TO LANDING; OUR PLAN WAS THE SPAWN WAHUU2 16R ARRIVAL. THE FIRST OFFICER HAD BEEN FLYING INTO DEN SEVERAL TIMES LATELY AND HAD EXPERIENCED [RUNWAY] 16R A MAJORITY OF THE TIME. SHE DID AN EXCELLENT JOB BRIEFING AND GOING OVER THE DESCENT PROFILE AND CHECKING THE FMC. TOD WAS ABOUT 35 MIN PRIOR TO LANDING SO WE HAD A GOOD 25 MINS AFTER BRIEF OF DRONE TIME. SOMEWHERE AFTER SLMON; WE WERE GIVEN DIRECT TO WAHUU AT 9;000 FT. THEN ABOUT MID-POINT; AND STILL A VERY CONTROLLED AND QUIET DAY WE WERE GIVEN A HEADING OFF THE ARRIVAL TOWARDS THE SOUTHWEST (DOGLEG TO FINAL) ALMOST POINTED RIGHT AT NEWLN. FIRST RECEIVED A DESCENT TO 8;000 FT. THEN 7;000 FT. RIGHT AT THE CLASS B BORDER WHERE THE FLOOR DROPS TO 7;000 FT. AT THIS POINT I DON'T REMEMBER BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THE CONTROLLER SAID EXPECT [RUNWAY] 16L BUT I DON'T REMEMBER HIM SAYING IT. WHEN WE WERE AT 7000 FT. AND SLOWING TO 210; THE CONTROLLER CLEARED US THE VISUAL. SO THIS MUCH I DO REMEMBER CLEARLY; HE CLEARED US THE VISUAL WITHOUT ASKING IF WE HAD THE AIRPORT IN SIGHT OR NAMING A RWY. WE WERE SLOWING. THE FIRST OFFICER WAS DOING A NICE JOB THINKING AHEAD AND I HEARD THE CONTROLLER VOICE WITH A QUICK CADENCE; SO I FELT HE WAS A LITTLE BUSY SO I ACCEPTED THE CLEARANCE; I EXTENDED JETSN AND THE FIRST OFFICER CONTINUED TO SLOW AND CONFIGURE. EVERYTHING WAS UNDER CONTROL UNTIL ABOUT THAT POINT. THE CONTROLLER CAME BACK AND ASKED IF WE HAD THE AIRPORT IN SIGHT WHICH WAS A LITTLE STRANGE SINCE WE ALREADY ACCEPTED THE VISUAL CLEARANCE BUT I ACKNOWLEDGED WE DID. HE THEN ASKED US TO MAINTAIN 180KTS TO LUWEE GO TO TOWER ON 135.3. THAT'S WHEN MY BRAIN WENT INTO OVERLOAD BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW WHERE LUWEE WAS. ABOUT THE TIME; WE REALIZED WE WERE CLEARED FOR [RUNWAY] 16L WE WERE OVERSHOOTING FINAL HEADING FOR [RUNWAY] 16R. THE FIRST OFFICER TURNED TO COME BACK ON FINAL FOR [RUNWAY] 16L WHEN I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS AN AIRBUS ABOVE AND NEXT TO US. MIND YOU; WE WERE IN A 20 DEGREE LEFT TURN AND I HAD VISUAL ON THE AIRCRAFT LOOKING OUTSIDE THE FIRST OFFICER R AFT WINDOW. AT THAT POINT; I ASKED HER FOR 30 DEGREE OF TURN WHICH SHE COMPLIED. SOMEWHERE IN THERE; WE RECEIVED A TCAS RA DESCEND WHICH SHE COMPLIED; ABOUT THEN TOWER CAME BACK AND ASKED IF WE HAD THE AIRCRAFT IN SIGHT WHICH I DID AND ACKNOWLEDGED. I FELT WE NEVER GOT ANY CLOSER THAN AN SFO APPROACH TO 28 BUT WERE WEREN'T EXPECTING TO BE THERE. BUT FACTORING IN THE TCAS WE MUST HAVE BEEN CLOSE OR WITH AN INITIAL VECTOR UNDERNEATH THE AIRBUS ON [RUNWAY] 16R FOR THE TCAS TO ISSUE A RA. THE FIRST OFFICER CONTINUED TO CONFIGURE AND SLOW WHILE I PROGRAMMED THE ILS AND FMC. SHE WAS LINED UP ON THE CLEARED RUNWAY NOW; SOMEWHERE BEFORE SEEING THE OTHER AIRCRAFT I DID ASK TOWER TO CONFIRM [RUNWAY] 16L; WHICH THEY DID. I FEEL SOMEWHERE ON ARRIVAL THE CONTROLLER MIGHT OF SAID EXPECT 16L BUT IT NEVER HIT ME; BUT AGAIN I'M NOT SURE. MY MISTAKE WAS NOT REVIEWING [RUNWAY] 16L AND I'M STILL CONFUSED AS TO WHY I DIDN'T EXPECT IT COMING IN FROM THE EAST. BY 1;000 FT. I HAD THE ILS AND FMC PROGRAMMED AND THE FIRST OFFICER HAD THE AIRCRAFT UNDER CONTROL AND CONFIGURING THE AIRCRAFT WHILE I SORTED OUT RUNWAY ALIGNMENT AND THEN HEADS DOWN TO TUNE THE ILS AND FMC. I BRIEFLY THOUGHT ABOUT A GO AROUND BUT FELT IT WOULD HAVE ADDED A LAYER OF CONFUSION WHEN BY 700 FT. WE WERE BACK IN NORMAL OPS. AFTER LANDING; WE GOT A CALL FROM THE FLIGHT ATTENDANTS ABOUT A FAINT SMELL OF BURNING PLASTIC IN THE CABIN. I ASKED IF IT WAS FUEL SMELL OR SMOKE IN THE CABIN WHICH I RECEIVED A NEGATIVE REPLY. AT THE TIME WERE STOPPED BUT ELECTED TO CONTINUE TO THE GATE. WE HAD TWO PILOTS IN THE BACK AND BOTH STOPPED BY TO SAY GOODBYE ONLY ONE COULD SMELL THE ODOR AND GAVE THE SAME DESCRIPTION OF ALMOST LIKE A PLASTIC BURNING. I REALLY THOUGHT THE PHONE CALL WAS GOING TO ASK IF WE WERE DOING A FORMATION APPROACH. EXPECTATION BIAS AND NOT REVIEWING APPROPRIATE APPROACHES ARE LESSENED LEARNED; I'VEALWAYS THOUGHT I WAS COGNIZANT OF EXPECTATION BIAS BUT MISSED IT THAT DAY. WE TALKED/BRIEFED AT LENGTH ABOUT CLASS B AIRSPACE AND THE PITFALLS OF DEN AND HIGH DESCENT RATES BUT MISSED OTHER THREATS LIKE RUNWAY CONFIGURATION AND WHO WAS GETTING WHAT RUNWAY IN FRONT OF US.,Air carrier flight crew reported clearance confusion resulting in overshooting final and airborne conflict.,2019,07
509,201907,FLORIDA,AT APPROXIMATELY 1;500 AGL THE JUMP SEAT OCCUPANT SAW A DRONE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO OUR AIRCRAFT. DURING THE RESULTING REPORTING TO TOWER I FAILED TO CALL FOR FINAL CONFIGURATION PRIOR TO 1;000 FEET. I DIDN'T REALIZE WE WERE BELOW 1;000 FEET UNTIL AFTER BEING FULLY CONFIGURED BY APPROXIMATELY 900 FEET. I BELIEVE I MISSED THE 1;000 FEET CALL DUE TO THE MULTIPLE 'BACK AND FORTHS' WITH TOWER. STABILIZED BY 500 WE CONTINUED FOR LANDING. AS THE PILOT FLYING I NEED TO INSULATE MYSELF FROM OTHER DUTIES AND CONCENTRATE ON FLYING.,A321 First Officer reported encountering a drone while on approach to MCO airport.,2019,07
510,201907,FLORIDA,ON FINAL APPROACH RUNWAY 17L AT MCO; AS PILOT MONITORING; WE SPOTTED A DRONE AT OUR ALTITUDE AT 1500 FEET MSL LESS THAN 1/2 MILE OFF TO THE LEFT; AS WE APPROACHED GLIDE-SLOPE INTERCEPT. WE WERE AT FLAPS 2; AND WOULD NORMALLY HAVE COMPLETED CONFIGURING THE AIRCRAFT FOR LANDING AND WOULD HAVE BEGUN THE BEFORE LANDING CHECKLIST BY 1500 FEET. HOWEVER; WE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THE DRONE TO ATC/TOWER WHICH CAUSED MORE DISTRACTIONS. CONFIRMING LOCATION OF THE DRONE AND PROVIDING A DESCRIPTION TO TOWER PUT US LATE CONFIGURING WITH GEAR AND FINAL FLAPS AS WE APPROACHED 1000 FEET AND BEGAN THE BEFORE LANDING CHECKLIST.  WE DESCENDED BELOW 1000 FEET BY THE TIME ALL WAS COMPLETE. EVERYTHING APPEARED STABLE FAIRLY QUICKLY AND THE FO (FIRST OFFICER) MADE A NORMAL LANDING.  WE BOTH AGREED AFTER LANDING; HOWEVER; THAT THE DISTRACTIONS FROM THE DRONE AND TOWER COMMUNICATIONS CAUSED US TO CONFIGURE LATER THAN NORMAL AND A GO-AROUND WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER COURSE OF ACTION.  DISTRACTIONS FROM DRONE AND ATC/TOWER CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCIDENT.  SUGGEST BETTER AWARENESS OF ALTITUDE ON FINAL APPROACH WHEN DISTRACTIONS OCCUR.,A321 Captain reported encountering a drone while on approach to Orlando International Airport.,2019,07
511,201907,FLORIDA,WHILE FLYING THE FLIPPER6 ARRIVAL AT APPROXIMATELY LUVLY INTERSECTION AND LEVEL AT 8;000 FT.; I OBSERVED A DRONE PASS TO THE LEFT AND JUST BELOW THE AIRCRAFT.  IT WAS BLACK; HAD 4 PROPELLERS AND WAS MOVING RAPIDLY IN THE SAME DIRECTION AS US.  IT HAD SOMETHING HANGING FROM IT; A PURSE OR DUFFEL BAG PERHAPS; MAYBE A PLASTIC BAG. I ONLY SAW IT FOR A FEW SECONDS AND REPORTED IT TO APPROACH CONTROL.  HE RESPONDED 'ANOTHER DRONE HUH?'.  IT WAS ABOUT 100 FT BELOW A 100 FT SOUTH OF US.,B-757 Captain reported encountering a drone on arrival into Miami.,2019,07
512,201907,ILLINOIS,OVER DOOGY FOR THE VISUAL 9L AT ORD; WE SAW A DRONE FLY OVERHEAD AS WE WERE DESCENDING ON THE GLIDE PATH; PROBABLY ABOVE US 300 TO 500 FT. REPORTED IT TO APPROACH CONTROL; AND CONTINUED A STABILIZED APPROACH AND LANDING. NO OTHER ISSUES.,B-737 Captain reported encountering a drone while on approach to O'Hare.,2019,07
513,201907,ILLINOIS,NEAR MISS WITH DRONE WHILE ON ARRIVAL INTO O'HARE. WEATHER: CLEAR AND CALM; WINDS WERE OUT OF EAST AT 4 KTS.  O'HARE WAS LANDING TO THE EAST; WE WERE ASSIGNED TO RUNWAY 10R ILS Y WITH A VISUAL APPROACH.  ON ARRIVAL WE WERE AT 10;000 FEET AND LEVEL AT 300 KTS ON THE ARRIVAL COURSE.  NOTE ATTACHED CHICAGO TAC CHART SHOWING APPROXIMATE LOCATION MARKED WITH A RED STAR.  I BELIEVE WE WERE ON THE VEEK4 ARRIVAL.  COMPLETELY UNEVENTFUL FLIGHT UP TO THIS POINT.  I WAS ADMIRING THE VIEW OF DOWNTOWN CHICAGO ON A NICE VFR SUMMER DAY FROM THE COPILOT'S SEAT.  THE COCKPIT WAS STERILE.  SUDDENLY; FROM MY RIGHT SIDE WINDOW DIVIDER POST; I SPOTTED AN OBJECT TRAVELING AT AN INCREDIBLE RATE OF SPEED OPPOSITE OUR FLIGHT PATH.  AS MY EYES FIXATED ON THE OBJECT; I REALIZED I WAS LOOKING AT A COMMERCIAL SIZED DRONE; QUAD-COPTER; GREY IN COLOR.  IT HAD A CAMERA MOUNT UNDER ITS BASE. I HAD VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE DRONE FOR APPROXIMATELY 1.5 TO 2 SECONDS BEFORE IT VANISHED BEHIND OUR RIGHT WING TIP AND OUT OF VIEW.  THE DRONE WAS EXACTLY LEVEL WITH OUR ALTITUDE; 10;000 FEET.  I ESTIMATED THE DRONE TO BE 100 FEET FROM OUR AIRCRAFT. MY IMMEDIATE ACTION AND DUE TO MY INCREASED HEART RATE WAS SHOUTING 'HOLY ____!' ON THE INTERCOM TO ALERT MY CAPTAIN.  HE LOOKED STUNNED AT ME AND ASKED; 'WHAT?' I EXPLAINED TO HIM EXACTLY WHAT I SAW AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.  MY CAPTAIN STATED HE DID NOT SEE IT; BUT WAS NOT LOOKING THAT WAY.  I DOUBTED MYSELF MOMENTARILY; BUT THE NEAR MISS REPLAYED ITSELF IN MY MIND.  I BELIEVE THIS DRONE OPERATOR WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF A CLEAR DAY UNAWARE OF THE AIRSPACE RULES OR PURPOSELY VIOLATING THE RULES TO GET A CLEAR IMAGE/PHOTOGRAPH OF THE ENTIRE CITY OF DOWNTOWN.  IT WAS PERFECTLY POSITIONED FOR A SHOT OF THE CITY GIVEN THE SUN POSITION AND TIME OF DAY.  HAD THE DRONE IMPACTED OUR AIRCRAFT; I FEAR TO THINK ABOUT WHAT THE RESULTS MAY HAVE BEEN; WHETHER IT HIT OUR WING ROOT; INGESTED INTO AN ENGINE; OR PENETRATED A COCKPIT WINDOW.  MY CAPTAIN ALERTED ATC AND AN ADVISORY BROADCAST WAS MADE BY CHICAGO APPROACH.  I HEARD NO FURTHER INFORMATION OR FEEDBACK FROM ATC OR THE FAA ONCE ON THE GROUND.  SUGGEST GREATER CRACKDOWNS ON DRONE OPERATIONS NEED TO EXIST.  OR DRONE MANUFACTURERS AND OPERATORS MUST HAVE TCAS REPORTING CAPABILITY/ADS-B SYSTEMS INCLUDED AS A MANDATORY REQUIREMENT.  I FLY A DRONE MYSELF; A HOBBY DRONE.  I AM ALSO HOLD A UAV DRONE CERTIFICATE.  HOWEVER; I CAN SEE SOMEONE CLEARLY AND EVENTUALLY USING A DRONE FOR MALICIOUS REASONS IF THEY SO DESIRED.  ULTIMATELY; I AM STILL SURPRISED THAT A DRONE WOULD BE CAPABLE OF A 10;000 FOOT OPERATION FROM THIS EXPERIENCE; BUT AFTER DOING A QUICK GOOGLE SEARCH; I SEE COMMERCIAL DRONES ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO; BUT ARE CAPABLE OF ALTITUDES OF 11;000 FEET OR HIGHER.,CRJ First Officer reported a near mid-air with a drone while level at 10;000 feet on arrival into O'Hare.,2019,07
514,201907,NEW JERSEY,WE WERE ON SHORT FINAL AT ABOUT 350 FEET ABOUT ONE MILE FROM THE RUNWAY. I SAW SOMETHING AT THE CORNER OF MY EYE ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. I ASSUMED IT WAS A BIRD BUT UPON CLOSER LOOK I COULD SEE THAT IT WAS A FOUR BLADED DRONE. I IMMEDIATELY NOTIFIED THE TOWER. HE CAME BACK A FEW MOMENTS LATER AND SAID 'YOU MEAN A BIRD?' I RESPONDED WITH A 'SURE A BIRD'; KNOWING THAT A DRONE WOULD SHUT DOWN THE AIRSPACE. THE CONTROLLER THEN NOTIFIED THE NEXT FEW AIRCRAFT IN LINE TO LAND.,An air carrier pilot reported a drone on short final.,2019,07
515,201907,NEW YORK,F/O (FIRST OFFICER) NOTICED DRONE BELOW OUR AIRCRAFT OVER LOWER MANHATTAN. I DID NOT SEE THE DRONE. F/O SAID IT WAS WHITE AND BLACK AND THOUGHT IT WAS FAIRLY LARGE MORE COMMERCIAL TYPE THAN HOME USE. HE REPORTED TO ATC AND THEY GAVE HIM A NUMBER TO CALL AFTER WE LANDED AND HE DID CALL.,B-737 Captain reported encountering a drone while on vectors to LGA.,2019,07
516,201907,NEW YORK,WHEN IN DECENT INTO LGA WE WERE INSTRUCTED TO DESCEND FROM 5000 TO 4000 FT. FLY OVER THE STATUE OF LIBERTY AND FLY UP THE HUDSON FOR THE ARRIVAL. WE COMPLIED AND AS WE WERE ABOUT 4500 FT.; AND JUST PRIOR TO OVERFLYING THE STATUE OF LIBERTY; I LOOKED DOWN AND SAW WHAT LOOKED TO BE A DRONE JUST BELOW US MAYBE 300-500 FEET BELOW. I SAW WHAT TO BE AN X TYPE DRONE WHITE WITH BLACK PROPELLERS AND GREEN AND RED BLINKING LIGHTS. I REPORTED TO ATC ABOUT THE DRONE INCIDENT ASKED IF THE CAPTAIN HAD SEEN IT; WHICH HE DID NOT; AND WE DID NOT NEED TO TAKE ANY EVASIVE ACTION FOR THE DRONE. WE CONTINUED IN TO THE AIRPORT NORMALLY AND HAD NO OTHER INCIDENTS. AFTER LANDING; I CONTACTED NYC TRACON AND TOLD HIM WHAT I WITNESSED AND THE INFORMATION OF WHAT HE WANTED TO KNOW.,B-737 First Officer reported encountering a drone while on vectors for landing at La Guardia.,2019,07
517,201907,NEW YORK,DURING AN ATC ASSIGNED DESCENT FROM 6;000 FEET TO 4;000 FEET ALONG V16 HEADING SOUTHBOUND; AT APPROXIMATELY 8 NM FROM JFK VOR I SAW AN OBJECT (PRESUMABLY A DRONE) WITH A GREEN LIGHT ON IT GO PAST MY LEFT WING. IT WAS VERY CLOSE; I ESTIMATE APPROXIMATELY 10 FEET OFF OF MY WING. I PASSED IT AS I WAS DESCENDING THROUGH 5;800 FEET.,PA28R pilot reported encountering a drone while on an airway near JFK airport.,2019,07
518,201907,OHIO,WHILE PREPARING TO LAND ON RUNWAY 24L AT CLE; ON SHORT FINAL AT ONLY 500 FEET AGL; AN OBJECT WAS SEEN IN FRONT OF THE AIRCRAFT ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF GLIDE PATH. IT MANEUVERED TO CROSS OUR FLIGHTPATH WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY AND WAS THOUGHT TO BE A BIRD. AS IT CAME DOWN THE LEFT SIDE OF OUR AIRPLANE THE FLIGHT CREW REALIZED IT WAS A SMALL WHITE UAV WITHIN 100 FEET OF THE COCKPIT. IT WAS TOO LATE TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION; AND WAS NOT POSSIBLE WITH ONLY SECONDS BEFORE TOUCHDOWN. THE UAV CAME DANGEROUSLY CLOSE TO THE LEFT WING AS WE PASSED IT AT AN ALTITUDE JUST BELOW 500 AGL. FLIGHT CREW ESTIMATES THE SIZE OF THE UAV TO BE 14' TO 28' IN SPAN; AND APPEARED TO BE A QUAD-COPTER STYLE DRONE THAT WAS WHITE IN COLOR. IT LOOKED TO BE FILMING US AS IT CROSSED OUR FLIGHTPATH FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. SUGGEST HAVING SPOTTERS IN THE TOWER TO KEEP AN EYE OUT FOR DRONES AROUND THE AIRPORT; AND UTILIZE POLICE TO DETAIN RESPONSIBLE PARTIES.,Embraer First Officer reported encountering a drone while on short final to CLE airport.,2019,07
519,201907,WASHINGTON,OPERATING FLIGHT TO SEA AS FIRST OFFICER AND THE PILOT FLYING.  WE HAD JUST BEEN VECTORED TO INTERCEPT THE LOCALIZER FOR RW16R AND WERE CLEARED ILS 16R APPROACH.  THEY HAD TOLD US TO SLOW OUR SPEED SO WE HAD OUR GEAR DOWN AND FLAPS 15 SELECTED.  JUST SOUTH OF INTERSTATE; A RELATIVE MOTION OF AN OBJECT CAUGHT MY EYE.  MY INITIAL REACTION FOR A COUPLE SECONDS WAS 'WHY THERE WAS AN AIRPLANE PASSING BELOW US GOING NORTH BOUND WHEN WERE ON AN APPROACH?'  BUT AS WE APPROACHED THE OBJECT; I WAS ABLE TO DISCERN THE OBJECT AS A DRONE.  I SAW FOUR FUZZY SILVER DISCS.  WHAT I WAS SEEING IS WHAT I BELIEVE TO BE WHITE LED LIGHTS ON THE UNIT REFLECTING OFF OF FOUR SPINNING PROPELLERS MAKING IT LOOK LIKE FUZZY SILVER DISCS.  THE DRONE APPEARED TO BE STRAIGHT AND LEVEL; NOT TILTED IN ANY DIRECTION AS THEY WOULD FOR FORWARD FLIGHT.  I BELIEVE IT WAS HOVERING.  THE DRONE PASSED DIRECTLY UNDER OUR NOSE.  BECAUSE WE WERE CENTERED ON THE RUNWAY'S LOCALIZER NEEDLE; THIS DRONE WAS ALSO DIRECTLY ON EXTENDED RUNWAY CENTERLINE.  WITH THE DRONE OPERATING APPARENTLY ALREADY ESTABLISHING THEIR DESIRED LOCATION; I IMAGINE WE WEREN'T THE FIRST PLANE THAT CAME INTO CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THIS DRONE ON THE LOCALIZER.  THE CAPTAIN WAS BUSY WITH MONITORING DUTIES AND DID NOT SEE THE DRONE SO CANNOT SPEAK TO IT. THE CAPTAIN REPORTED THE DRONE SIGHTING TO SEA TOWER ATC.  THIS IS MY FIRST TIME SEEING A DRONE FROM THE FLIGHT DECK OF AN AIRCRAFT.  IT'S HARD TO GIVE A GOOD COMPARISON; BUT COMPARING THIS OBJECT TO PASSING AIRPLANES AT 1;000 FEET ALTITUDE SEPARATION; I ESTIMATE THE DRONE TO HAVE PASSED JUST A COUPLE OR FEW HUNDRED FEET FROM OUR ALTITUDE.  WE WERE DESCENDING THRU ABOUT 3;500 FEET MSL AT THE TIME I SAW THE DRONE.  AFTER LANDING AND DURING CONVERSATION WITH A POLICE OFFICER AND REFERENCING GOOGLE MAPS.  I BELIEVE A GOOD GROUND LOCATION WE FLEW OVER AT THE TIME OF THE DRONE SIGHTING TO BE IN THE AREA OF LAKE VIEW CEMETERY AND VOLUNTEER PARK CONSERVATORY.  A POLICE REPORT WAS FILED AT THE COMPLETION OF THE FLIGHT.REQUIRE DRONE MANUFACTURES TO IMPLEMENT TECHNOLOGY THAT COMMUNICATES WITH AIRCRAFTS TCAS TRAFFIC AVOIDANCE SYSTEMS AS DRONE OPERATORS; IN MY OPINION; WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO BREAK DRONE AIRSPACE RULES AND REGULATIONS.,First Officer reported near midair collision with a drone while centered on the localizer during approach.,2019,07
520,201908,ARIZONA,WHILE TRANSITIONING FROM THE RNAV ARRIVAL TO THE APPROACH; A UAS PASSED DIRECTLY UNDER US; PROBABLY WITHIN A COUPLE HUNDRED FEET. THE FIRST OFFICER SAW IT; AND COULD NOT IDENTIFY WHAT KIND OR EXACTLY THE SIZE; BUT SAW A GLINT OF METAL; SAID IT SEEMED MAYBE SEVERAL FEET IN DIAMETER. NO INDICATIONS SHOWED UP ON THE TCAS. WE WERE LEVELING OFF AT 5;000 FEET HEADING WEST. WE REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO ATC; AND RESPONDED TO THEIR QUESTIONS IN STAGES (WORKLOAD PERMITTING).,An air carrier pilot reported a NMAC with a UAS.,2019,08
521,201908,CALIFORNIA,APPROACHING FAP; AN OBJECT SUDDENLY APPEARED IN THE WINDSCREEN. BEFORE I COULD EVEN COMMUNICATE A WARNING IT FLEW JUST OVERHEAD OF OUR AIRCRAFT. PILOT FLYING DID NOT SEE THE OBJECT AS IT PASSED DIRECTLY OVERHEAD WITHIN 50 FEET. I IMMEDIATELY COMMENTED ON A NEAR MISS WITH SOME TYPE OF UNIDENTIFIED OBJECT. MY INITIAL THOUGHT IT WAS A LARGE FLAT TYPE OF BALLOON ALTHOUGH IT APPEARED SOLID IN NATURE AS IT FLASHED BY. ATIS INFORMATION HAD NOTED AN UNAUTHORIZED DRONE FLYING; WHICH HAD BEEN REPORTED FLYING EAST OF THE AIRPORT NORTH OF THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE.,B737-700 Captain reported an NMAC with a UAV on final approach to SAN airport.,2019,08
522,201908,CALIFORNIA,HAD TO DEVIATE FROM COURSE TO THE LEFT TO AVOID WHAT LOOKED LIKE A DRONE AND MAY HAVE BRIEFLY ENCROACHED A TFR AREA (CAL BERKLEY FOOTBALL STADIUM) TO AVOID CONTACT WITH THIS OBJECT.,C172 Instructor reported deviating to miss a possible drone resulting in TFR encroachment.,2019,08
523,201908,DC,DESCENDING INTO IAD AT APPROXIMATELY 4;500 FT. AND 250 KNOTS; INSIDE MCQUE INTERSECTION ON THE MAPEL 2 ARRIVAL FOR RUNWAY 19L; THE CAPTAIN'S WINDSHIELD SUDDENLY SHATTERED. THE CAPTAIN WAS LOOKING DOWN AT THE TIME; HOWEVER BOTH THE [RELIEF PILOT] AND MYSELF; THE FLYING FIRST OFFICER; SAW SOMETHING STRIKE THE WINDSHIELD. THE CAPTAIN'S WINDSHIELD WAS COMPLETELY SHATTERED (BUT THE INNER PANE WAS STILL INTACT) SO I TOOK OVER AND LANDED THE AIRCRAFT AT HIS DIRECTION. THERE WERE NO INJURIES. AT FIRST WE ASSUMED THAT THIS WAS A BIRD STRIKE; HOWEVER AFTER LANDING WE EXAMINED THE WINDOW BOTH INSIDE AND OUTSIDE WITH MAINTENANCE AND WE SAW NO EVIDENCE OF ANY BIRD REMAINS OR BLOOD. AFTER FURTHER REFLECTION; WE FELT THAT THIS VERY POSSIBLY COULD HAVE BEEN A DRONE STRIKE; AS THERE WAS A CLEAR AREA ON THE WINDSHIELD SHOWING WHERE SOMETHING HIT IT; WITH THE CRACKS RADIATING FROM IT; BUT WITH NO EVIDENCE OF BIOLOGICAL MATERIAL.,First Officer reported Captain's windshield was shattered during final approach by a possible collision with a drone.,2019,08
524,201908,IDAHO,I HAD CANCELED MY IFR FLIGHT PLAN IN THE AIR AND WAS ENTERING THE DIJ TRAFFIC PATTERN FOR RUNWAY 22. UPON SETTING UP AND WHILE ENTERING THE 45 ENTRY FOR RIGHT DOWNWIND 22 THE AIRCRAFT WAS STRUCK BY A MEDIUM SIZE BIRD WHICH APPEARED 30-50' IN FRONT OF THE AIRCRAFT. IMPACT WAS OBVIOUS DUE TO THE SOUND AND DEBRIS ON THE WINDSHIELD. I CONTINUED TO ENTER THE PATTERN NORMALLY AND LANDED WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. UPON LANDING; A VISUAL INSPECTION DETERMINED THE BIRD HAD IMPACTED THE RADOME CAUSING SERIOUS DAMAGE.,Corporate pilot reported a bird strike to the radome while landing at DIJ.,2019,08
525,201908,NEBRASKA,ON DESCENT INTO OMA AT 6;700 FEET; AN OBJECT APPEARING TO BE A DRONE; BUT POSSIBLY BALLOONS; APPEARED AT 1 O'CLOCK AND SLIGHTLY BELOW US. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE IT MOVED FROM RIGHT TO LEFT AND WENT RIGHT UNDER OUR LEFT WING. TO ME IT APPEARED TO HAVE LIGHTS ON IT; WHICH IS WHY MY IMMEDIATE THOUGHT WAS DRONE. IT ALL HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY AND THERE WAS NO TIME TO MANEUVER TO AVOID. WE IMMEDIATELY MADE A RADIO CALL TO APPROACH; WHO WAS CURRENTLY HANDLING US; TO TRY AND PINPOINT THE EXACT LOCATION. NO SOUNDS OR EVIDENCE OF IMPACT NOTICED. I WILL ADD THAT IF THIS WAS INDEED A DRONE; WE BETTER FIGURE IT OUT QUICKLY; AS IT WOULD BE AN OBVIOUS EASY ENTRY; LOW COST THREAT TO NATIONAL SECURITY.,B737 Captain reported NMAC with a UAV.,2019,08
526,201908,NEW JERSEY,UPON DEPARTURE FROM ZZZ; OBSERVED SMALL QUAD-COPTER TYPE DRONE COLORED RED AND BLACK PASS OVERHEAD OUR AIRCRAFT WHILE CLIMBING THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 900 FEET MSL.  ESTIMATED  WITHIN 50 FEET DIRECTLY OVER OUR DEPARTURE PATH.  REPORTED THE SIGHTING IMMEDIATELY TO TOWER BEFORE SWITCHING TO DEPARTURE FREQUENCY.  REMAINDER OF FLIGHT UNEVENTFUL.,An air carrier pilot reported a NMAC with a drone.,2019,08
527,201908,PENNSYLVANIA,I WAS SCENIC FLYING 4;500 FEET; VFR; FLIGHT FOLLOWING WITH APPROACH.  FLYING A HEADING OF 252; I OBSERVED WHAT I THOUGHT WAS ANOTHER AIRCRAFT SOME DISTANCE OFF MY LEFT SIDE AND AT A MUCH HIGHER ALTITUDE. VERY QUICKLY; I DETERMINED THE OBJECT WAS MUCH CLOSER THAN FIRST PERCEIVED AND THOUGHT IT MAYBE A ROGUE BALLOON. AS I FLEW PAST THE OBJECT; IT WAS IDENTIFIED AS SOME TYPE OF QUAD-COPTER; WHITE IN COLOR. THE OBJECT WAS ABOUT 75 YARDS TO MY LEFT AND 33 YARDS ABOVE AS WE PASSED IT. I CANNOT QUALIFY IF IT WAS COMING TOWARD US OR WE WERE OVERTAKING IT. APPROACH WAS IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED AND ASKED IF THERE WAS ANY DRONE ACTIVITY IN THE AREA AND ADVISED OF THE SIGHTING. THERE WERE NO FURTHER INCIDENTS THE REMAINDER OF THE FLIGHT.,A Cessna pilot reported a near miss with a Drone.,2019,08
528,201908,PENNSYLVANIA,ON FINAL ABOUT TWO MILES OUT AT 600 FEET; WE OBSERVED WHAT LOOKED TO BE A DRONE PASSING THE AIRCRAFT ON THE LEFT. IT WAS RED AND WHITE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A SMALL GOOSE. I RECALL IT PASSING OFF OUR LEFT WING BY ABOUT 50 FEET AT OUR ALTITUDE. I MADE A SLIGHT BANK TO THE RIGHT BUT WE WERE PAST IT SO FAST THAT IT WOULDN'T HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE IF IT WAS ON TRACK TO HIT US. WE REPORTED IT TO THE TOWER AND LANDED WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. THE TOWER CONTROLLER GAVE ME A NUMBER TO CALL. I CALLED THE TOWER AND GAVE THEM THE DETAILS OF THE INCIDENT. WE SAW THE DRONE FLY BY THE LEFT WING; WE COULD ONLY SEE IT FOR ABOUT 2 SECONDS. THE DRONE WAS FLYING TOO HIGH NEAR A BUSY AIRPORT. I BANKED SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT AS A REFLEX AND CONTINUED THE APPROACH. HOPEFULLY WE CAN COLLECT A DATA BASE OF DRONE SIGHTING DESCRIPTIONS. POLICE COULD USE THIS DATA BASE SO THAT WHEN THEY SEE DRONES FLYING AROUND AIRPORTS EVEN AT LEGAL ALTITUDES; THEY CAN SEE IF THE DRONE MATCHES ANY DESCRIPTIONS OF NEAR MISS SITUATIONS AND ACT ACCORDINGLY.,An air carrier pilot on short final reported a NMAC with a drone.,2019,08
529,201909,ARIZONA,IN THE RIGHT TURN TO FINAL (APPROX. 2.5 NM FINAL RWY21 AT KGYR); CREW SAW A WHITE UAS SLIGHTLY LEFT AND BELOW THE AIRCRAFT. THE APPROXIMATE DISTANCE TO THE UAS/DRONE WAS 100 FEET. CREW CONTINUED THE APPROACH AND INFORMED ATC.,Flight Instructor reported experiencing a close airborne conflict with a drone.,2019,09
530,201909,CALIFORNIA,CLIMBING OUT OF SJC AT 7;900 [FEET]; WE HAD A NEAR MISS WITH A DRONE. IT PASSED OFF THE LEFT HAND SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT AT EXTREMELY CLOSE PROXIMITY. THE FLASHING RED LIGHT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION AND I SAW IT AS WE FLEW BY. ATC WAS UNAWARE OF DRONE LOCATION.,ERJ-175 Pilot Flying reported a NMAC on the departure routing.,2019,09
531,201909,GEORGIA,I WAS PILOT MONITORING ON OUR WAY INTO ATL. WE WERE APPROXIMATELY AT 1;500 OR SO FEET ON FINAL INTO [RUNWAY] 8L WHEN I NOTICED A LARGE WHITE DRONE AIRCRAFT OFF TO OUR LOWER LEFT SIDE MOVING WEST BOUND APPROXIMATELY 500 FT. BELOW US. THE BEST GROUND REFERENCE I COULD MAKE WAS THE LARGE MANUFACTURING WAREHOUSE WITH THE 'BJ'S' LOGO PAINTED ON THE ROOF. IT WAS WHITE AND HAD FOUR PROPS. I NOTIFIED ATC OF SUCH WHICH THEY PASSED ON PILOT REPORTS AND RELAYED INTO THE ATIS. AFTER LANDING; TOWER REQUESTED A PHONE CALL FOR FOLLOW UP. THE [AIRLINER] TWO AIRCRAFT BACK ALSO SAW THE DRONE CIRCLING AN APARTMENT COMPLEX. I CALLED ATC AT THE GATE IN WHICH THEY TOOK DOWN BASIC INFORMATION AND ASKED IF WE TOOK EVASIVE ACTION; WHICH WE HAD NOT. THE EVENT WAS CAUSED BY AN INDIVIDUAL OR INDIVIDUALS ILLEGALLY OPERATING A UAS WITHIN 5NM OF AN AIRFIELD. I MIGHT SUGGEST SOME GUIDANCE IN A MEMO OR CFM/FOM PROCEDURE ON OPERATIONS IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES AS DRONE ENCOUNTERS ARE BECOMING MORE AND MORE FREQUENT.,Captain reported encountering a drone while on approach to ATL.,2019,09
532,201909,KENTUCKY,ON FINAL APPROACH INTO SDF; THE FIRST OFFICER MENTIONED HE HAD HEARD A (THUMP) ON FINAL APPROACH. THE FIRST OFFICER SUGGESTED IT COULD BE A BIRD STRIKE AND WE AGREED TO CHECK THE AIRCRAFT OUT THOROUGHLY BEFORE WE SHUT DOWN FOR THE NIGHT. THE FIRST OFFICER MENTIONED THAT HE NOTICED A MARK (ON THE WING) BUT WAS UNCLEAR IF IT HAD BEEN A BIRD OR NOT. MAINTENANCE ARRIVED ON THE SCENE WHILE WE WERE BOTH HAVING THE CONVERSATION AND I TOLD THE MAINTENANCE TECHNICIAN WHAT OUR CONCERN WAS. I WENT ON TO SAY THAT I WOULD CALL DISPATCH AND MAKE A LOGBOOK ENTRY. THE MAINTENANCE TECHNICIAN TOLD US NOT TO WORRY AND THAT HE WAS DOING AN OVERNIGHT MAINTENANCE CHECK AND HE WOULD TAKE CARE OF EVERYTHING. I THEN SUGGESTED THAT WE MAKE THE ENTRY AND THE MAINTENANCE TECHNICIAN SAID ONCE AGAIN 'NO!' I WILL TAKE CARE OF IT AND I THEN PUSHED ONE MORE TIME AND ASKED HIM IF HE WAS SURE AND THAT IT WOULD ONLY TAKE A MOMENT AND HE AGAIN SAID 'NO!' AFTER OUR CONVERSATION WE CONTINUED OUR NORMAL AND FINAL DUTIES BEFORE DEPARTING THE AIRCRAFT FOR THE NIGHT. AS WE WERE WALKING DOWN THE TERMINAL WE WERE INTERCEPTED BY A RAMPER THAT OVERHEARD OUR CONVERSATION WITH THE MAINTENANCE TECHNICIAN. THE RAMPER THEN ASKED IF WE HAD HIT A BIRD AND WE ONLY TOLD HIM WE SUSPECTED A STRIKE BUT IT WAS UNCLEAR AND THAT MAINTENANCE WAS DOWN TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE ON HIS OVERNIGHT CHECKS. THE RAMPER ASKED WHAT ALTITUDE THAT WE SUSPECTED THAT WE MADE CONTACT AND WE GAVE THE ALTITUDE OF SOMEWHERE BETWEEN 2500 AND 3000 ON FINAL AND THEN WE CONTINUED TO THE HOTEL.I SHOULD HAVE PLACED AN ENTRY INTO THE LOGBOOK ANYWAY. I WAS TOLD 'NO' THREE TIMES BY THE MAINTENANCE MAN TO NOT MAKE AN ENTRY.  WE WERE SORT OF IN A BACK AND FOURTH ON WHAT WAS THE CORRECT THING TO DO. THE CORRECT THING WAS TO PLACE THE ENTRY INTO THE BOOK.,CRJ Captain reported that a Maintenance Technician pressured him not to make a logbook entry for a suspected bird strike; resulting in a policy deviation.,2019,09
533,201909,NEW YORK,FLYING NEAR FRG; WE GOT A YELLOW TCAS TARGET WITH NO ALTITUDE GIVEN. WE WERE AWARE WE WERE LOW OVER AN AIRPORT AND SCANNED THE AREA. THE TARGET EVENTUALLY DISAPPEARED AND WE ASSUMED IT WAS A FALSE RETURN. THE CAPTAIN (PILOT MONITORING) HAPPENED TO GLANCE OVER HIS LEFT SHOULDER AND GAVE A STARTLED EXCLAMATION AND INFORMED ME THAT WE CAME VERY CLOSE TO A DRONE. WE DID SEE THE YELLOW TARGET REAPPEAR ON TCAS WITH NO ALTITUDE FOR A MOMENT AFTER THAT. HE THEN REPORTED TO ATC; WHO ASKED FOR DETAILS (IT WAS BLACK AND GREEN). IT WAS ALREADY BEHIND US AT THIS POINT AND NO FURTHER ACTION WAS TAKEN IN REGARDS TO AIRCRAFT OPERATION. I PERSONALLY NEVER SAW THE DRONE; ONLY THE TCAS TARGET SO I'M UNABLE TO SAY HOW CLOSE WE REALLY CAME. I'M CONFIDENT WE DID EVERYTHING WE COULD TO MITIGATE THE RISK. THE APPEARANCE ON TCAS WAS FAST AND INTERMITTENT. GIVEN THE LACK OF ALTITUDE INFORMATION IT MADE IT HARDER TO SEE WHERE TO LOOK. AFTER WE'D REPORTED THE ISSUE TO ATC AND LEFT THE PROXIMITY; WE COULD HERE ATC WARN OTHER AIRCRAFT IN THE VICINITY; BUT WE NEVER HEARD ANYONE ELSE SAY ANYTHING AND WE SWITCHED FREQUENCIES SOON AFTER.,An Air carrier pilot reported a NMAC with a Drone.,2019,09
534,201909,NEW YORK,AS WERE TAXIING SOUTHEAST ON TAXIWAY ALPHA; ANOTHER INBOUND AIRCRAFT WAS STOPPED ADJACENT TO PERPENDICULAR TAXIWAY KILO. AHEAD OF THAT AIRCRAFT THERE WAS AN OUTBOUND AIRCRAFT ATTEMPTING TO GET ACCESS TO TAXIWAY BRAVO. HE WAS POINTED NORTHEAST ON TAXIWAY LIMA. THERE WAS A LONG LINE OF AIRCRAFT ON BRAVO WAITING TO DEPART [RUNWAY] 31. THE AIRCRAFT IN FRONT OF US WAS CLEARED INTO HIS GATE AT SPOT X AND QUICKLY MOVED OUT OF OUR WAY. WE WERE TO ACCESS GATE X BY USING SPOT Y. THE AIRCRAFT WAITING TO ACCESS BRAVO WAS ON LIMA WITH HIS TAIL POINTING OUT INTO TAXIWAY ALPHA. BY THIS TIME; I HAD PULLED UP MY LGA 10-9B CHART FOR MORE DETAIL OF THE TERMINAL C AREA. IT WAS FAIRLY DARK THAT NIGHT; ESPECIALLY SO BECAUSE OUR TAXI LIGHT WAS MEL'D. I HAD BEEN USING THE RIGHT FIXED LANDING LIGHT UNTIL WE WERE SOUTHEAST ON ALPHA. I DIDN'T WANT TO INTERFERE WITH THE TRAFFIC TAKING OFF ON [RUNWAY] 31.I'M VERY MUCH AWARE OF THE PROCEDURES IN AND OUT OF THE LGA RAMP AREA. I FLY IN QUITE FREQUENTLY AND AM FAMILIAR WITH THE PROBLEMS WE WERE HAVING LATELY WITH GREEN ISLANDS. WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND; I MADE A COMMENT TO MY FIRST OFFICER THAT I DIDN'T KNOW WHY THEY WOULDN'T LET US USE SPOT X. THERE WAS CLEARLY AN AIRCRAFT IN THE WAY OF US HAVING ACCESS TO SPOT Y. I WONDERED ALOUD WHY THE RAMP CONTROLLER WOULDN'T HAVE CLEARED US IN AT SPOT X; ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE WAS NOT MUCH GOING ON IN THE RAMP AREA AND HE LIKELY HAD A BIRD'S EYE VIEW OF OUR HOLD-UP. LOOKING AT MY DISPLAYED 10-9B CHART OF THE RAMP AND NOT SEEING ANY ISLANDS DETECTED EAST OF SPOT X; I ASKED THE FIRST OFFICER OUT LOUD 'DO YOU HAVE ANY PROBLEM WITH ME COMING A LITTLE RIGHT AROUND THIS AIRCRAFT (AT LIMA)? HE SAID 'NO.' I TURNED THE NOSE SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT; EXPECTING TO REJOIN ALPHA AFTER CLEARING AROUND THE OTHER AIRCRAFT. AS I DID; I SAW BLUE REFLECTORS ON SMALL POLES. IT WAS CLEAR NOW THAT THERE WAS AN ISLAND BETWEEN SPOT X AND SPOT Y. AT THIS POINT; I SLOWED THE AIRCRAFT AND TURNED MORE; AS TO ENTER THE RAMP AT SPOT X. I COULD NOT TURN BACK LEFT AT THIS POINT. I ASKED THE FIRST OFFICER TO ASK RAMP IF WE COULD COME IN AT SPOT X. JUST AS WE TURNED; RAMP CONTROL GOT ON THE FREQUENCY AND STATED 'COMPANY; YOU CAN'T JUST COME IN ANY SPOT YOU WANT. THERE ARE RULES.' HE WENT ON. AT THE GATE; WE LOOKED AT THE CHARTS MORE. THE 10-9B CHART IS COMPLETELY MISSING THE ISLAND BETWEEN SPOT X AND SPOT Y. THE DEPICTION OF THE ISLAND IN FRONT OF CONCOURSE B ON THE 10-9 CHART IS COMPLETELY WRONG - IT DEPICTS THE ISLAND AS CONTINUOUS FROM SPOT Z ALL THE WAY DOWN TO SPOT Y. HOW CAN THESE CHARTS BE WRONG SO LONG AFTER CONSTRUCTION IS COMPLETE?! WE DEPEND ON THESE CHARTS TO BE ACCURATE. THE ONLY CHART THAT APPEARS TO BE CORRECT IS THE COMPANY LGA SIP PAGE. THAT CHART HAS A RED 'DO NOT TAXI' NOTATION DETECTED ON IT - PERHAPS THE OFFICIAL JEPPESSEN CHARTS THAT WE USE FOR NAVIGATION SHOULD TOO. YES; WE WERE AWARE OF THE STATEMENT UNDER 'TAXI IN' THAT DIRECTS US NOT TO CUT ACROSS FOR ACCESS. IT WAS NOT OUR INTENTION TO DO SO; ONLY THE RESULT OF A MISSING ISLAND FROM THE 10-9B. THESE CHARTS REALLY SHOULD BE CORRECTED; TO ACCURATELY DEPICT THE ACTUAL LOCATIONS OF THE ISLANDS.,B737-700 Captain reported the island at position 8A on the Jeppsen 10-9 chart is not depicted on the 10-9B chart; causing confusion and possible taxiway incursion.,2019,09
535,201909,NEW YORK,MY PARTNER AND I WERE ASSIGNED TO DO AN ETOPS INSPECTION ON AIRCRAFT X. WHILE DOING OUR WALK AROUND; WE FOUND EVIDENCE OF A BIRD STRIKE ON THE FIRST OFFICER'S SIDE; AFT OF THE RADOME; AND BEFORE THE PITOT TUBES. AT THAT TIME WE TOLD OUR CREW CHIEF; AND SUPERVISOR THAT WE HAD THE ITEM; AND OUR CREW CHIEF PULLED UP THE BIRD STRIKE INSPECTION PAPERWORK. WHILE ACCOMPLISHING THE CARD; STEP 5; TELLS US TO DEACTIVATE THE GCS ANTENNA; OR TO [SKIP] THIS IF NO INDICATION OF BIRD STRIKE ON THE CROWN. THE ISSUE WITH THIS IS WE'RE TOLD IN STEP 2 TO DO AN INSPECTION FROM THE GROUND (IN WHICH CASE; YOU CAN'T SEE THE CROWN OF THE AIRPLANE). THE NEXT ITEM WE HAD; WAS STEP 7 (IN THE NOTES) THAT 'IF GCS IS INSTALLED; INSPECT THE GCS ANTENNA RADOME. WHEN WE PULLED THAT AMM (AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE MANUAL) REFERENCE; THIS WAS A DETAILED INSPECTION; OF WHICH THE ANTENNA NEEDED TO BE REMOVED TO PROPERLY INSPECT IT. WE THEN CONTACTED ENGINEERING; FOR RELIEF FROM THESE ITEMS; AS WE COULD NOT ACCOMPLISH THEM AS THEY WERE WRITTEN. AN ENGINEERING AUTHORIZATION WAS ISSUED. WE THOUGHT NOTHING OF THIS; UNTIL WE WERE BROUGHT IN TODAY TO DO THE 5 QUESTION PART OF THE INVESTIGATION FORM; BY MANAGER. WE FOUND THIS ODD; AS HE WAS PRESENT AT THE TIME THIS ISSUE WAS DEVELOPING; AND OUR UNDERSTANDING; WAS THAT ANYONE INVOLVED IN THE ISSUE; AND WOULDN'T BE INVOLVED IN THE INVESTIGATION FORM PROCESS.,Technician reported a procedural deficiency in the Aircraft Maintenance Manual that required an Engineering Authorization.,2019,09
536,201909,OHIO,PILOT REPORTED NEAR MID-AIR COLLISION WITH AN OBJECT THAT APPEARED TO BE A UAS.,Pilot reported NMAC with what appeared to be a UAS.,2019,09
537,201909,OHIO,I WAS FLYING AT APPROXIMATELY 5;500 FEET AT ABOUT 80 KNOTS AIRSPEED. I WAS USING VFR FLIGHT FOLLOWING; WAS IN CONTACT WITH AKRON-CANTON (CAK) APPROACH CONTROL ON 125.50 MHZ; AND WAS SQUAWKING AN ASSIGNED TRANSPONDER CODE.I PASSED AN OBJECT THAT APPEARED TO BE AN UNMANNED AIRCRAFT VEHICLE (UAV). THE UAV WAS GENERALLY SPHERICAL IN SHAPE AND ABOUT SIX TO TWELVE INCHES IN DIAMETER. THE UAV ALSO APPEARED TO HAVE PROTRUSIONS OR EXTENSIONS; THAT COULD HAVE BEEN ROTORS AND ROTOR MOUNTS. THE UAV WAS GENERALLY BLACK; WITH OTHER COLOR(S). THE UAV PASSED LESS THAN TWO HUNDRED FEET TO MY RIGHT; AND LESS THAN FIFTY FEET BELOW. IT PASSED GENERALLY PARALLEL TO MY TRACK OF FLIGHT. THE UAV MAY HAVE BEEN TRAVELING IN THE SAME OR OPPOSITE DIRECTION AS MY TRACK OF FLIGHT; OR IT MAY HAVE BEEN NEARLY STATIONARY. I DID NOT PERCEIVE ANY RELATIVE LATERAL MOTION. THE TOTAL TIME OF OBSERVATION WAS LESS THAN TWO SECONDS.WITHIN TEN SECONDS I KEYED MY MICROPHONE; AND SAID 'AKRON APPROACH; LIGHT EXPERIMENTAL [TAIL NUMBER];' OR NEARLY IDENTICAL WORDS TO THE SAME EFFECT. THERE WAS SOME DELAY IN ESTABLISHING COMMUNICATION WITH THE CONTROLLER WHO INITIALLY REPEATED MY ASSIGNED TRANSPONDER CODE. I ADVISED THE CONTROLLER THAT I WAS ALREADY USING VFR FLIGHT FOLLOWING. WHEN THE CONTROLLER ASKED THE PURPOSE OF MY TRANSMISSION; I STATED I WISHED TO REPORT BEING NEARLY STRUCK BY A DRONE. SUBSEQUENTLY; A CONTROLLER ASKED THAT I TELEPHONE [NUMBER REMOVED]. I AGREED AND THE REST OF THE FLIGHT PROCEEDED WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT. AFTER PARKING THE AIRCRAFT; I MADE A FEW NOTES; CALLED THE NUMBER; AND MADE AN (AUDIO RECORDED) REPORT WITH CAK APPROACH CONTROL.,Experimental aircraft pilot reported an NMAC with a UAV.,2019,09
538,201909,PENNSYLVANIA,AIRCRAFT X WAS DEPARTING AN UNCONTROLLED AIRPORT. THERE WERE SEVERAL VFR AIRCRAFT FLYING IN THE VICINITY. CEILINGS WERE APPROXIMATELY 2;500 FT. WINDS WERE 130/09. ALL OF OUR AIRPORTS WERE OPERATING IN AN EAST CONFIGURATION. AIRCRAFT X WAS DEPARTING AND CLIMBING OUT. I NOTICED WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN UNIDENTIFIED VFR AIRCRAFT ESTABLISHED ON THE ILS FOR THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION RUNWAY. I CALLED TRAFFIC TO THE DEPARTING AIRCRAFT. THEY DID NOT SEE THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION INBOUND. I TURNED THE DEPARTURE TO A 180 HEADING BELOW THE MVA TO AVOID A MID-AIR COLLISION AS THE CLIMB AND DESCENT RATES OF BOTH AIRCRAFT WERE COMPARABLE AND WOULD HAVE BOTH BEEN AT APPROXIMATELY 1;500 FT. AT THE SAME PLACE AND TIME. THE DEPARTURE TURNED AND CONTINUED TO CLIMB WITHOUT INCIDENT. I QUESTIONED THE PILOT ON WHETHER THE VFR AIRCRAFT HAD MADE ANY ANNOUNCEMENT OF THEIR POSITION AND INTENTIONS ON THE UNICOM FREQUENCY. THE PILOT STATED HE HEARD NO ANNOUNCEMENTS. THE VFR AIRCRAFT NEVER CHANGED COURSE WHICH LED ME TO BELIEVE HE WAS NOT AWARE OF THE DEPARTURE. I TRIED TO RAISE THE VFR AIRCRAFT ON THE GUARD FREQUENCY AS IT CONTINUED PRACTICE APPROACHES; BUT WAS UNSUCCESSFUL.,TRACON controller reported vectoring an aircraft below MVA to avoid conflict with a VFR aircraft not on frequency.,2019,09
539,201909,TEXAS,AIRCRAFT X DRONE DEPARTED FROM EFD AIRPORT WITH AIRCRAFT Z CHASE PLANE BOTH VFR. I ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAN JAC POSITION WHILE AIRCRAFT X AND Z WERE EAST OF EFD AIRPORT AT 025 MSL. THE AIRCRAFT REQUEST TO CLIMB TO 035; THEN 055; THEN 075 AND PROCEEDED OUTBOUND TO THE SOUTH; SOUTHEAST ON A PROFILE ROUTING. I PULLED UP THE REQUESTED LOST LINK W-ZZZ PROCEDURE IN MY OVERHEAD DATABASE AND ACTIVATED THE MAP OVERLAY ON MY DISPLAY. THE AIRCRAFT WERE POINTED TO INTRA-FACILITY SECTORS VIA AUTOMATION AND THEN VERBALLY POINTED OUT TO HOUSTON CENTER OFF-SHORE SECTOR. THE AIRCRAFT HAD INDICATED THAT COULD MAINTAIN RADIO COMMUNICATIONS THROUGHOUT HIS MISSION PROFILE SO ELECTED TO KEEP HIM ON MY FREQUENCY FOR A LITTLE LONGER. I ASKED THE PILOT IF HE WAS ONLY GOING TO CLIMB TO 095 AS PUBLISHED IN THE PROFILE. HE REPLIED AFFIRMATIVE. PRIOR TO REACHING POINT 9 ON THE ROUTE; I TERMINATED RADAR SERVICES WITH THE AIRCRAFT X AND Z FLIGHT; INSTRUCTING THEM TO REMAIN ON THEIR CURRENT BEACON CODES AND TO ADVISE ME WHEN THEY WERE INBOUND BACK TO EFD AIRPORT. I LATER BRIEFED THE RELIEVING CONTROLLER OF THE SITUATION AND DIDN'T THINK ANYTHING OF IT. THE NEXT DAY I WAS TOLD THAT THE AIRCRAFT X HAD CLIMBED AS HIGH AS FL280 AND AT SOME POINT CAME IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO AIRCRAFT Y ON DEPARTURE. THE CHASE PLANE HAD REMAINED BELOW 095 AS PUBLISHED. APPARENTLY THE UAS OPERATORS FROM EFD HAD FORWARDED THEIR WEEKLY SCHEDULE TO BOTH HOUSTON TRACON AND CENTER. THE SCHEDULE REFLECTED THE CLIMB TO FLIGHT LEVELS ON THE APPROPRIATE DAY AND TIME. THE SCHEDULE WAS DISSEMINATED TO THE FRONT LINE SUPERVISORS; HOWEVER THE CONTROLLERS AT THE POSITION WERE NEVER BRIEFED BY THE SUPERVISOR THAT THE ALTITUDES WOULD BE NON-STANDARD. BETTER DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION TO THE ACTUAL CONTROLLERS WORKING THE OPERATION BY BOTH MANAGEMENT AND BY THE OPERATOR WHILE ON FREQUENCY. I DEFINITELY WOULD HAVE HANDED THE AIRCRAFT OFF TO HOUSTON CENTER HAD I KNOWN THEIR INTENTION WAS TO CLIMB ABOVE 095 FEET.,I90 Controller reported failure of facility to brief Controllers on tactical activities resulted in a UAV altitude deviation and conflict.,2019,09
540,201909,WASHINGTON,AIRCRAFT X WAS EXECUTING A GO AROUND DUE TO A POSSIBLE BIRD STRIKE ON THE PRECEDING ARRIVAL. I TURNED AIRCRAFT X BACK INTO A DOWNWIND; AND MANUALLY COORDINATED WITH FINAL THAT HE WAS LEVEL AT 3000 FEET DUE TO AIRCRAFT Y CROSSING THE AIRPORT WESTBOUND AT 4000 FEET. FINALS WOULD NEED TO CLIMB AIRCRAFT X WHEN HE WAS CLEAR OF TRAFFIC TO ENSURE SEPARATION WITH THE BFI FINAL AT 2200 FEET. I CALLED THE TRAFFIC TO AIRCRAFT X AND TURNED HIM NORTHBOUND INTO THE DOWNWIND. I COORDINATED A POINT OUT OFF OF THE LANDLINE TO THE BFI ARRIVAL CONTROLLER ON AIRCRAFT X. AT THE SAME TIME I WAS DOING THE MANUAL POINT OUT; I SAW AIRCRAFT Y APPEARED TO BE IN A DESCENT. I TURNED AIRCRAFT X TO A 250 HEADING; ASKED HIM TO EXPEDITE; AND DISPLAYED HIS DATA BLOCK ON THE SATELLITE CONTROLLER'S SCOPE. I CALLED SATELLITE AND ASKED THEM TO TURN THEIR TRAFFIC NORTHBOUND.THE COMPLEXITY AROUND SEATAC AND BOEING CREATES A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS. AIRCRAFT Y HAD BEEN DISPLAYED BUT NOT POINTED OUT TO THE ARRIVAL D CONTROLLER. IT IS NOT CLEAR IF THEY HAD BEEN POINTED OUT TO FINALS; AND SATELLITE HAD ASSUMED THE AIRCRAFT HAD BEEN POINTED OUT; GIVING HIM CONTROL FOR DESCENT. I DON'T HAVE A SPECIFIC AIRSPACE RECOMMENDATION. THE SATELLITE CONTROLLER HAD TOLD ME LATER HE THOUGHT AIRCRAFT X WAS A DEPARTURE; NOT A GO AROUND; AND WOULD BE CLIMBING ABOVE HIS TRAFFIC.,S46 TRACON Controller reported a loss of separation due to confusing coordination and complex airspace between adjacent airports.,2019,09
541,201910,CALIFORNIA,THE AIRCRAFT HAD A DEFERRAL FOR THE POWER CONTROL UNIT MONITOR SYSTEM. THE MEL HAS NO OPERATIONAL LIMITATIONS. I WAS THE PILOT FLYING. THIS WAS A BUSY; VERY SHORT FLIGHT FROM ZZZ TO SNA. THE AIRCRAFT WAS LDS (LARGE DISPLAY SYSTEM). I HAVE FLOWN LDS AIRCRAFT INFREQUENTLY AND MY PREVIOUS 31 YEARS OF FLYING HAVE BEEN ROUND DIALS. WE BRIEFED THE ENTIRE FLIGHT IN THE BLOCKS BECAUSE WE KNEW WE WOULD BE SO BUSY IN FLIGHT. WE WERE EMPTY SO WE BRIEFED A POTENTIAL LOW ALTITUDE CAPTURE. WE WERE CLEARED TO 4;000 FEET MSL ON DEPARTURE. THE SUN WAS RIGHT IN OUR EYES. THE FO (FIRST OFFICER) HAD A SUNSHADE UP AND I WAS WEARING SUNGLASSES AND A CAP TO BLOCK THE SUN. THE AP (AUTOPILOT) WAS ENGAGED AT APPROXIMATELY 2;500 FEET MSL. THE AIRPLANE WAS CLIMBING NORMALLY. I HAD PRESET THE SNA LOCALIZER; BUT PARKED THE FREQUENCY. PRIOR TO TOP OF CLIMB I BRIEFLY LOOKED DOWN TO DIAL IN THE LOC FREQUENCY (AN OBVIOUS MISTAKE). THE PM (PILOT MONITORING) CALLED 'ALTITUDE' AS THE AIRCRAFT CONTINUED THROUGH 4;000 FEET. I DISCONNECTED THE AP AND PUSHED THE AIRPLANE OVER TO 4;000 FEET. I THINK WE WENT NO HIGHER THAN 4;250 FEET. I WAS HAVING A HARD TIME SEEING THE DISPLAY DUE TO THE SUN. NEITHER OF US SAW A LOW ALTITUDE CAPTURE; AND WERE SURPRISED THE AIRPLANE DID NOT LEVEL AT THE SELECTED ALTITUDE. THE AP WAS REENGAGED.THINGS WERE BUSY WITH RADIO; TRAFFIC; AND SETTING UP FOR THE APPROACH. I SLOWED THE AIRCRAFT AND WE SELECTED FLAPS ONE. SHORTLY THEREAFTER WE WERE CLEARED TO 3;000 FEET NEARING THE APPROACH INTERCEPT. I SELECTED FLIGHT LEVEL CHANGE AND EXTENDED THE SPEEDBRAKES. I SELECTED SPEED 170 KTS. AND CALLED FOR FLAPS 5. ALL THIS TIME ATC; TRAFFIC AND FOLLOWING THE PM'S ACTIONS DREW MY ATTENTION. AS WE REACHED 3;000 FEET THE AIRCRAFT LEVELED; BUT THE AT (AUTOTHROTTLES) DID NOT ADVANCE. THE AIRSPEED DROPPED BELOW 170 KTS. AND WAS TRENDING DOWN. AS I PUSHED THE THROTTLES UP AND CALLED FOR FLAPS 15 THE PM CALLED OUT AIRSPEED. AIRSPEED WAS NOT INCREASING SO I DISCONNECTED THE AP AND ATS AND VERIFIED FULL THROTTLE. IT WAS THEN I REALIZED THE SPEED BRAKE WAS STILL EXTENDED. I RETRACTED THE SPEEDBRAKES. AT THAT TIME THE AIRSPEED INCREASED AND WE BALLOONED TO APPROXIMATELY 3;900 FEET. NO FLAP LIMITS WERE EXCEEDED. THE ATS AND AP WERE REENGAGED. WE ADVISED ATC OF OUR SITUATION AND REQUESTED VECTORS TO GET SET UP AGAIN AND EVALUATE OUR STATUS.SINCE WE WERE SO NEAR; WE CALLED ZZZ OPERATIONS AS WE CONSIDERED CONTACTING MAINTENANCE TO ASK IF THE DEFERRAL SHOULD HAVE ANY IMPACT ON THE AUTOFLIGHT SYSTEM. DURING THE VECTORS WE WERE PLACED IN A LONG LINE OF ARRIVALS AND HAD TIME TO BE FULLY PREPARED FOR OUR NEXT APPROACH. WE WERE GIVEN ALTITUDE CHANGES AND HEADING CHANGES. THROUGHOUT THE VECTORS AND ATC CLIMBS AND DESCENTS THE AIRCRAFT SEEMED TO BE OPERATING NORMALLY. WHEN FINALLY CLEARED FOR THE APPROACH WE WERE CONFIDENT THINGS WERE NORMAL AND THE REMAINDER OF THE FLIGHT WAS NORMAL. ATC NEVER ADVISED OF ANY DEVIATIONS OR VIOLATIONS. ON THE GROUND THE MECHANIC SAID THE DEFERRAL WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE AIRCRAFT GOING THROUGH SELECTED ALTITUDE OR AT OPERATION. WE NEVER HAD ANY EICAS OR MESSAGES. I DON'T KNOW WHY THE ATS DID NOT COME UP BUT I DO KNOW I MISSED THE SPEEDBRAKES! IF I HAVE SPEEDBRAKES EXTENDED I NORMALLY KEEP MY HAND ON THE HANDLE WITH MY ARM AGAINST THE THROTTLES. IF THE THROTTLES COME UP IT'S A GOOD REMINDER TO RETRACT THE SPEEDBRAKES IF I FORGET. THIS TIME I TOOK MY HAND OFF OF THE SPEEDBRAKE HANDLE AS I WAS BUSY MANIPULATING THE MCP. I'VE DONE THIS SHORT BUSY FLIGHT BEFORE WITHOUT ANY OF THESE MISTAKES. I THINK MY LIMITED EXPOSURE TO LDS AIRCRAFT (THE AIRSPEED AND ALTITUDE TRENDS ARE NOT QUITE AS INTUITIVE AS ROUND DIALS FOR ME YET) COMBINED WITH A HIGH WORKLOAD FLIGHT WAS DEFINITELY A MAJOR CONTRIBUTING FACTOR FOR MY ERRORS. I WILL WORK ON THIS AND NOT TRUST THE AIRCRAFT TO DO WHAT I THINK IT SHOULD DO.,Air carrier flight crew reported exceeding cleared-to altitude during approach to SNA airport; as well as slowing below flap minimum speed due to autopilot and autothrottle malfunctions.,2019,10
542,201910,CALIFORNIA,IN ROUTE TO MYF ON AN IFR FLIGHT PLAN IN VMC; I SAW A DOD DRONE (INVERTED V TAIL) PASS OVERHEAD APPROXIMATELY 1;000 [FEET] ABOVE. AT THE SAME TIME; MY GARMIN G3000 PFD INDICATED THAT I HAD A LARGE MAGNETIC VARIATION ERROR; AND IN TURN THE PFD INDICATED THAT I WAS NOW FLYING TO A NEW WAY POINT (TCH VOR) LOCATED IN UTAH; WELL OFF MY FLIGHT PLAN BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. LATER AND SECOND WAY POINT IN MONTANA WAS INTRODUCED. THE MFD STILL SHOWED THE ORIGINAL FLIGHT PLAN; BUT THE PFD WAS IN CONFLICT; WHICH RESULTED IN A LOSS OF ABILITY TO FLY AN INSTRUMENT APPROACH OF ANY KIND; AND LOSS OF SYNTHETIC VISION WITHIN THE PFD. HAD IT NOT BEEN A VMC DAY ALLOWING ME TO FLY A VISUAL APPROACH; I WOULD HAVE HAD TO [ADVISE ATC] - AND FIND A WAY TO LAND WITHOUT ANY RELIABLE APPROACH CAPABILITY.THE SYSTEM HAS SINCE BEEN CHECKED AND IS OPERATING CORRECTLY; BUT IT SEEMS PRETTY CLEAR THIS WAS SOME TYPE OF INTERFERENCE / JAMMING ARISING FROM THE DOD DRONE. CLEARLY; THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO ALL AIRCRAFT; AND BECAUSE IF OCCURRED WITHIN THE LA AIRSPACE IT IS A SERIOUS THREAT TO SAFE FLIGHTS,PA46 pilot reported after a UAV encounter the PFD in the aircraft produced a large navigational error. The reporter suspects GPS jamming.,2019,10
543,201910,FLORIDA,I WAS ON THE VOR/DME A APPROACH. ATC INSTRUCTED US TO MAINTAIN 1;500 FEET AND TO GO ALL THE WAY TO THE MISSED APPROACH POINT BEFORE GOING MISSED DUE TO OTHER TRAFFIC THAT WAS IN THE PATTERN. THIS SEEMED FAIRLY ROUTINE TO ME. I CAREFULLY EXPLAINED TO MY STUDENT WHAT ATC MEANT AND HE UNDERSTOOD WHAT WAS GOING ON. AS WE CONTINUED I KEPT MY SCAN GOING OUTSIDE TO ENSURE WE WOULD NOT COLLIDE WITH ANYTHING. DIRECTLY OVER THE AIRFIELD JUST BEFORE WE REACHED THE MISSED APPROACH POINT I GLANCED LEFT AND SAW A DRONE OF SOME TYPE AT OUR ALTITUDE AND WITH 500 FEET OF US. AFTER THE INITIAL SHOCK OF SEEING A DRONE THAT HIGH I REALIZED THAT IT WOULD NOT HIT US. I NOTIFIED ATC IMMEDIATELY OF THE DRONE THAT WAS OVER THE AIRFIELD AND THE CONTROLLER SEEMED SHOCKED TO HEAR THAT REPORT FROM ME. AFTER THAT HE HANDED ME BACK OFF TO APPROACH.,A pilot reported an NMAC with a Drone while on approach to ISM airport.,2019,10
544,201910,OHIO,ON FINAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 28L AT CMH AND 300 FEET AGL; WE ENCOUNTERED A LARGE DRONE JUST OFF THE LEFT FRONT OF THE COCKPIT AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE US. WE DID NOT HAVE TO DIVERT FROM COURSE; BUT THE DRONE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY CLOSE. NO INCIDENT. REPORTED IMMEDIATELY TO THE TOWER.,Air carrier Captain reported a drone encounter during approach that did not require evasive action.,2019,10
545,201910,PENNSYLVANIA,WE WERE MAKING A VISUAL APPROACH TO 27R IN CLEAR VFR CONDITIONS WITH LIGHT WINDS DOWN THE RUNWAY. WHEN WE WERE LESS THAN 1000 FEET [AGL]; WE SAW AN AIRBUS CROSSING AT THE END OF THE RUNWAY AND BOTH COMMENTED THAT WAS TIGHT FOR US. IT WAS TIGHT BUT HE WAS SAFELY OFF THE RUNWAY WHEN WE ARRIVED AT THE RUNWAY. IN THE FLARE; THE AIRCRAFT ROLLED HARD LEFT. THE CAPTAIN APPLIED OPPOSITE AILERON AND PARTIALLY RECOVERED. WE BALLOONED DURING THE MANEUVER AND ELECTED TO GO AROUND. WHILE SPOOLING THE ENGINES (IAE); WE HIT THE RUNWAY AND ROLLED A FEW HUNDRED FEET BEFORE LIFTING OFF AGAIN. ONCE WE BEGAN THE CLIMB WE HAD ALL SORTS OF BELLS AND WHISTLES AND I CALLED OUT THAT WE LOST BOTH OF OUR AILERONS AND WERE IN A DEGRADED LAW. WE HAD OUR HANDS FULL BUT WERE ABLE TO GAIN CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT. WE RETURNED TO 27L FOR A NORMAL LANDING. THIS OCCURRED BECAUSE WE THINK THE AIRCRAFT THAT CROSSED INCREASED POWER WHEN HE SAW US ON SHORT FINAL; WHICH DISTURBED THE AIR FROM THE JET BLAST THAT CAUSED US TO ROLL. HE WASN'T FULLY PAST THE HOLD SHORT LINE UNTIL WE WERE BELOW 200 FEET. WE WERE BOTH AWARE A GO AROUND WAS A VERY REAL POSSIBILITY BECAUSE OF THE AIRCRAFT ON THE RUNWAY BUT WAS NOT NEEDED. AFTER ROLLING; THE CAPTAIN DID THE RIGHT THING AND CALLED GO AROUND. AFTER LIFTOFF WE ARE UNSURE WHY WE LOST BOTH AILERONS. MY THEORY IS THE AIRCRAFT WENT INTO ABNORMAL MODE AS WE WERE IN DIRECT MODE (USE MANUAL PITCH TRIM) UNTIL ABOUT 1000 FEET WHERE IT SWITCHED TO ALTERNATE MODE. WE WERE NOT AWARE THE ELAC FAILED; WHICH MAINTENANCE TOLD US LATER. IT DID POP UP BRIEFLY ON THE ECAM AFTER LANDING THE SECOND TIME BUT WENT AWAY. WE WORKED WELL TOGETHER AND ALTHOUGH EVERYTHING WASN'T PERFECT; I THINK WE HANDLED THE SITUATION IN A GOOD MANNER. IT WAS SPLIT SECOND DECISIONS AND CALLING OUT THE PROBLEMS AS WE WENT. THE CAPTAIN SAID THAT WHEN I YELLED OUT LOUD THAT WE LOST AUTOPILOT; AUTO THRUST; AILERONS THAT IT MADE HIM REALIZE WHAT WAS AVAILABLE AND FOCUS ON HEADING; ALTITUDE; AND SPEED AND IGNORE ALL OF THE OTHER INTERFERENCE. WE TRANSFERRED CONTROLS SO I FLEW AND HANDLED THE RADIO WHILE HE DID THE CHECKLISTS AND COMMUNICATION. THE STARTLE FACTOR WAS DEFINITELY PRESENT; BUT MUSCLE MEMORY TOOK OVER. THE TRAINING A FEW TIMES AGO FOR REJECTED LANDINGS AFTER TOUCHING DOWN WAS VITAL IN THE GOOD OUTCOME WE HAD. THE A FLIGHT ATTENDANT STATED THAT SHE WAS CONFUSED WITH THE NEW PROCEDURES ABOUT A PRECAUTIONARY LANDING AND THOUGHT WE WOULD SAY REMAIN SEATED THREE TIMES. I BELIEVE WE SOMETIMES GET TOO DEEP IN THE PROCEDURES THAT ALL OF US MISS THE BIG PICTURE OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. WITH ALL OF THE CHANGES WE HAVE HAD; IT'S EASY TO BECOME CONFUSED AND HAVE DIFFERENT EXPECTATIONS DURING A TRUE EMERGENCY.,A-321 First Officer reported executing a go-around following a low-altitude upset; probably related to jet blast or wake from an aircraft landing on a crossing runway.,2019,10
546,201910,PENNSYLVANIA,I LOOKED UP THE ADDRESS ON FAA/UAS S CHART. I MISINTERPRETED THE LAANC GRID. I THOUGHT BELOW 400 FEET WAS CLASS G AIRSPACE. THIS WAS DISCOVERED BY THE COMPANY THAT DOES MONTHLY REVIEWS. THE MANAGER OF THIS PROGRAM BROUGHT THE VIOLATION TO MY ATTENTION. WE GOT TOGETHER AND DISCUSSED MISUNDERSTANDING OF THE AIRSPACE AND WILL GET THE AUTHORIZATION IN THE FUTURE.,A Drone pilot reported a Class B airspace violation.,2019,10
547,201910,TEXAS,MY STUDENT AND I WERE PRACTICING LANDINGS. WHILE IN THE DOWNWIND OF THE TRAFFIC PATTERN FOR RUNWAY 17 AT FTW WE FLEW PAST A DRONE. WE DID NOT HAVE TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION. THE DRONE WAS APPROXIMATELY 100 FT. AWAY FROM OUR WING. THE DRONE APPEARED TO BE ORANGE-RED IN COLOR AND WAS ABOUT THE SIZE OF A FOREARM. WE MADE THE REPORT TO TOWER SHORTLY AFTER SEEING THE DRONE. DURING OUR NEXT LAP IN THE TRAFFIC PATTERN WE LOOKED FOR THE DRONE AGAIN; BUT WE WERE UNABLE TO FIND IT.,Flight Instructor reported a near mid-air collision in the traffic pattern with a drone.,2019,10
548,201910,WASHINGTON,I WAS DISTRACTED BY AN OUTSIDE OBJECT; A BALLOON (MAYBE); A POTENTIAL FLIGHT RISK/ HAZARD.  NEAR NORTH END AND SLIGHTLY WEST OF LAKE SAMMAMISH. I EXCEED THE FLOOR OF SEATTLE'S CLASS BRAVO AIRSPACE BY ABOUT 300 FT. OR SO; THE FLOOR IS 3;000 FT. AFTER CLEARING POTENTIAL CONFLICT; I DESCENDED TO A SUITABLE ALTITUDE BELOW SEATTLE'S CLASS BRAVO AIRSPACE.,Mooney M20C pilot reported an airspace incursion while being distracted by a UAV (balloon).,2019,10
549,201911,FLORIDA,I WAS FLIGHT INSTRUCTING IN OUR AIRCRAFT FROM THE BACKSEAT (MY STUDENT WAS AT THE CONTROLS IN THE FRONT SEAT). WE WERE CONDUCTING CROSSWIND TAKEOFF TECHNIQUES AND HAD BEEN CLEARED TOUCH AND GO RUNWAY 06 AT ISM. BECAUSE THE WINDS WERE COMING APPROXIMATELY 080 AT 12 KTS; PROPER TECHNIQUE IS TO GET ON THE UPWIND (RIGHT) WHEEL WITH THE TAILWHEEL UP; AND MAINTAIN DIRECTIONAL CONTROL AS YOU ROLL DOWN THE RUNWAY. MY STUDENT WAS ON THE RIGHT WHEEL WHICH IN TURN KEPT THE RIGHT WING LOWER; BLOCKING BOTH HIS AND MY VIEW FROM TAXIWAY ALPHA COMING UP ON OUR RIGHT. WE HAD JUST CROSSED OVER THE RUNWAY 15-33/6-24 INTERSECTION AT THE CENTER OF ISM AND MY STUDENT YELLED OUT AND APPLIED FULL POWER; ACCELERATED TO ROTATION SPEED THEN BANKED TO THE RIGHT AS HE GOT ABOUT 10 FEET IN THE AIR. THIS ALL WAS IN A SPAN OF ABOUT 3 SECONDS. IT WAS AT THIS TIME THAT AIRCRAFT Y CAME INTO MY VIEW FROM THE BACKSEAT; DIRECTLY TO OUR LEFT; CROSSING ACTIVE RUNWAY 06 SOUTH TO NORTH ON TAXIWAY ALPHA. WE WERE LUCKY TO BE CLOSE TO FLYING AIRSPEED BECAUSE THE IMMEDIATE APPLICATION OF POWER RESULTED IN US BECOMING AIR BORN QUICK ENOUGH TO BANK TO THE RIGHT AND AVOID AIRCRAFT Y. WE AVOIDED STRIKING THE AIRCRAFT Y BY APPROXIMATELY 15 FEET LATERALLY AND WERE ROUGHLY 2 FEET HIGHER THAN THEIR VERTICAL STABILIZER. I DID NOT ATTEMPT TO TAKE THE CONTROLS FROM OR MANIPULATE HIS INPUTS BECAUSE HIS ACTIONS WERE NOT UNSAFE TO US AND I KNEW HE HAD SEEN SOMETHING IN THE FRONT SEAT THAT I COULD NOT SEE YET IN THE BACK (BIRD AVOIDANCE IS VERY COMMON HERE AND I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT'S WHAT HE WAS DOING). I CHOSE NOT TO TAKE THE CONTROLS BECAUSE HE WAS NOT CLOSE TO STALL AND DID NOT WANT TO MAKE THE SITUATION (ONE THAT I DIDN'T KNOW THE NATURE OF YET) WORSE. HAD I TAKEN THE CONTROLS AND STEERED US BACK ONTO THE RUNWAY; WE WOULD HAVE EITHER STRUCK AIRCRAFT Y WITH OUR FRONT FUSELAGE OR LANDING GEAR. MY STUDENT'S ACTIONS WERE CORRECT AND SAVED OURS AND HER LIFE. MY STUDENT WAS A HIGH TIME AIRLINE PILOT AND WAS TRAINING FOR HIS TAILWHEEL ENDORSEMENT. WE CONTINUED TO DO TOUCH AND GO'S FOR ABOUT 30 MORE MINUTES AND WERE INFORMED BY THE TOWER THAT WE NEEDED TO CALL THEM UPON OUR RETURN TO LANDING; WHICH WE DID AND MY STUDENT PROVIDED HIS CONTACT INFORMATION. WHAT APPEARS TO HAVE CAUSED THIS SITUATION WAS THE PILOT OF AIRCRAFT Y NOT FOLLOWING TAXI INSTRUCTIONS TO HOLD SHORT RUNWAY 06 ON TAXIWAY ALPHA; AS WE HAD BEEN CLEARED TOUCH AND GO. WE ARE AN AIRPORT WITH A LOT OF FLIGHT SCHOOLS SO MISTAKES HAPPEN; BUT INSTALLMENT OF A HOTSPOT ON THE AIRPORT DIAGRAM FOR STRESSING IMPORTANCE OF NOT ONLY RECEIVING CLEARANCE TO CROSS ALL RUNWAYS (ACTIVE AND NON-ACTIVE); BUT ALSO TO VISUALLY SCAN THE APPROACH END OF THE RUNWAY PRIOR TO CROSSING; AS IS TAUGHT TO US DURING OUR PPL PHASE OF TRAINING.,Small aircraft instructor reported an NMAC with ground traffic crossing runway.,2019,11
550,201911,FLORIDA,I WAS PILOT FLYING AND SECOND PILOT WAS HANDLING COMMUNICATIONS. ON APPROXIMATELY A 4 MILE FINAL APPROACH FOR RUNWAY 9 RIGHT; AFTER BEING CLEARED TO LAND; WE RECEIVED INSTRUCTION TO SLOW DOWN. IMMEDIATELY AFTER; HE INSTRUCTED US TO 'TURN LEFT; LEFT TURN FOR SPACING.' WE ACKNOWLEDGED BY REPEATING THE INSTRUCTION AND TURNED LEFT TO THE NORTH AS INSTRUCTED. THIS INSTRUCTION WOULD MAKE US CROSS THE FINAL APPROACH FOR RUNWAY 9L WHICH IS TIGHTLY SPACED FROM RUNWAY 9R. BOTH THE PILOT FLYING AND I BELIEVED WE HAD RECEIVED THE INSTRUCTION BECAUSE THERE WAS NO TRAFFIC ON FINAL FOR RUNWAY 9L. WE ALSO DID NOT SEE ANY TRAFFIC ON FINAL FOR RUNWAY 9L ON OUR TCAS (THIS OTHER RUNWAY 9L IS HANDLED BY A DIFFERENT FREQUENCY WHICH WE WERE NOT MONITORING). AFTER WE TURNED WE CONTEMPLATED CALLING FOR CONFIRMATION THAT WE COULD CROSS RUNWAY 9L'S APPROACH BUT WE WERE UNABLE DUE TO THE BUSY FREQUENCY. EVEN THOUGH CONCERNED; WE TO DEVIATE FROM THE INSTRUCTION TO FLY NORTH AND POTENTIALLY CREATE OTHER CONFLICT. WE CONTINUED AND CROSSED THE FINAL APPROACH DID NOT WANT OR RUNWAY 9L. AFTERWARDS A SLIGHT LEFT TURN TOWARDS THE WEST WAS MADE TO AVOID BIRDS AND SECONDS LATER CORRECTED BACK TO THE NORTH. AT THIS TIME THE CONTROLLER ASKED US IF WE HAD MADE A 360. WE REPLIED WE WERE TRAVELING NORTH FOR SPACING AS INSTRUCTED. HE INCORRECTLY INFORMED US THAT WE HAD MADE A 360 AND THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BE ON FINAL FOR RUNWAY 9R. HE ADDED THAT HE ONLY WANTED US TO GO NORTH AND THEN BACK SOUTH. THIS WAS NEVER STATED IN THE ORIGINAL INSTRUCTION. WE MADE A RIGHT TO THE SOUTH AND JOINED THE FINAL FOR RUNWAY 9R. WE ATTEMPTED TO CONFIRM THAT WE WERE CLEARED TO LAND A COUPLE OF TIMES BUT THE CONTROLLER WAS AT THE TIME COMPLAINING ON THE BUSY FREQUENCY ABOUT OTHER PILOTS NOT LISTENING. WE FINALLY RECEIVED CONFORMATION AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. WE BELIEVE THERE WAS NO CONFLICT WITH OTHER TRAFFIC.IT IS WORTH NOTING THAT DURING THE INCIDENT THE SAME CONTROLLER HAD INSTRUCTED AN AIRPLANE THAT HAD CALLED IN FOR LANDING 9 MILES EAST OF THE FIELD TO GO NORTH ON THE SHORELINE. HE LATER INSTRUCTED THE AIRPLANE TO TURN RIGHT TO THE WEST. THE PILOT ATTEMPTED TO CORRECT THE CONTROLLER BY STATING HE WAS EAST OF THE FIELD. MEANING THAT A TURN TO THE RIGHT WOULD NOT BE A TURN TO THE WEST BUT A TURN TO THE EAST INSTEAD. INSTEAD OF ACCEPTING THE ERROR THE CONTROLLER BECAME CONFRONTATIONAL AND REPEATED THE INSTRUCTION WITHOUT CORRECTING IT. TELLING THE AIRPLANE THAT HE KNEW HE HAD TURNED HIM TO THE NORTH; BUT NOW HE WANTED HIM TO TURN RIGHT TO THE WEST. AGAIN COMPOUNDING ON THE ERRONEOUS INSTRUCTION. SIMILAR INCIDENTS OF GIVING PILOTS INSTRUCTIONS TO TURN TO THE WRONG DIRECTION WERE HEARD SINCE WE BEGAN TO MONITOR THE FREQUENCY.IT IS ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT THE AREA WAS BUSY WITH WHAT WAS APPARENTLY HEAVY STUDENT TRAFFIC HAVING TROUBLE REPEATING AND COMPLYING WITH INSTRUCTIONS. THIS WAS IN ADDITION TO UNUSUALLY HEAVY TRAFFIC ARRIVING AND DEPARTING.IN SUMMARY; WE LEARNED FROM THE INCIDENT AND HAVE DECIDED TO INCREASE OUR CRM COMMUNICATION SKILLS. NEXT TIME WE WILL BE MORE INSISTENT IN RECEIVING CLARIFICATIONS AND EXPRESSING OUR CONCERNS WHEN GIVEN AN INSTRUCTION THAT WOULD MAKE US CROSS AN ACTIVE APPROACH PATH TO ANOTHER RUNWAY. ALSO SEE OTHER CREW MEMBER'S PILOTS REPORT.,GA pilot reported a communication breakdown and unprofessional conduct by ATC.,2019,11
551,201911,FLORIDA,REPORTER WAS PILOT FLYING. PART 91 FLIGHT TO OPF; ON ILS FOR RUNWAY 30 IN VMC CONDITIONS. WAS WARNED BY ATC OF UNKNOWN DRONE OPERATING IN VICINITY OF EXTENDED CENTERLINE OF RUNWAY. WE SPOTTED DRONE DURING THE DESCENT ON THE ILS AT APPROXIMATELY 1500 FEET AT WITHIN 100 FEET OF OUR ALTITUDE APPROXIMATELY 200-300 FEET FROM OUR LEFT SIDE 10 O'CLOCK. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN SEPARATION. WE INFORMED ATC. DRONE WAS DEFINITELY OPERATING IN VIOLATION OF UAS REGULATIONS. DRONE WAS DARK COLORED AND APPEARED TO HAVE MULTIPLE ROTORS ON THE TOP OF THE BODY; LOOKED SIMILAR TO A DRONE THAT WOULD BE PURCHASED COMMERCIALLY FOR PERSONAL USE.,Gulfstream V Captain reported a NMAC with UAV on final approach to OPF.,2019,11
552,201911,NEW JERSEY,CAPTAIN WAS VISUALLY FLYING THE EWR RUNWAY 04R APPROACH WITH THE AUTOPILOT DISENGAGED. SKY WAS CLEAR AND THE WINDS WERE 320/15 KTS. THE FLIGHT WAS STABLE AND ON SPEED AT VPP (FINAL APPROACH SPEED) 145 KTS. AT APPROXIMATELY 800-900 FEET AGL; THE CAPTAIN'S AIRSPEED SUDDENLY DECREASED TO 80 KTS AND FLUCTUATED UP TO 100 KTS. KNOWING THIS MUST BE INSTRUMENTATION FAILURE; I MAINTAINED PITCH AND POWER AND FLYING DUTIES TILL I CONFIRMED THAT THE FO INSTRUMENTS WERE GIVING CORRECT INFORMATION. HE REPLIED OF AN AIRSPEED OF APPROXIMATELY 150 KTS AND EVERYTHING ELSE LOOK GOOD. WITH THIS INFORMATION; I TRANSFERRED CONTROL OF THE AIRCRAFT TO THE FO WHO CONTINUED THE APPROACH UNEVENTFULLY TO LANDING. ONCE AT THE GATE; IT WAS CONFIRMED THAT WE HAD A BIRD STRIKE DIRECTLY ON THE CAPTAIN'S PITOT TUBE.,A321 Captain reported a bird strike occurred on the Captain's side pitot tube; causing erratic airspeed fluctuations.,2019,11
553,201911,PENNSYLVANIA,PILOT FLYING OBSERVED [A] DRONE FLYING 50 FEET ABOVE US JUST OUTSIDE OF FINAL APPROACH FIX. NO ACTIONS TAKEN. NOTIFIED ATC.,B767 Captain reported sighting a drone nearby while on approach to PHL airport.,2019,11
554,201911,TEXAS,WHILE FLYING DUE EAST AT 3000 FEET; APPROXIMATELY 17 MILES EAST OF THE ADDISON AIRPORT; I ENCOUNTERED A GOLD COLORED UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE OF SOME VARIETY. AT FIRST; I BELIEVED IT WAS A MYLAR BALLOON; BUT IT WAS QUICKLY OBVIOUS THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY A DRONE OF SOME SORT. IT WAS EXACTLY AT MY ALTITUDE; AND PASSED AT MOST 50 FEET FROM MY RIGHT WING. BY [THE] TIME; I SAW IT; I TURNED TO THE LEFT; BUT IT WAS NEARLY ALREADY PAST AT THAT POINT. THERE WAS NO ADS-B TRACK. I WAS MONITORING 122.8; WHICH IS USED IN THE LAKE LAVON/LAKE RAY HUBBARD PRACTICE AREAS; AS WELL AS MOST OF THE NEARBY AIRPORTS. I ADVISED OF THE NEAR-MISS TO OTHER PILOTS ON FREQUENCY; BUT TOOK NO FURTHER ACTION.,C172 pilot reported NMAC with a UAV.,2019,11
555,201912,CALIFORNIA,AN UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT PASSED BETWEEN ME AND THE GROUND; AT THE FAF (FINAL APPROACH FIX) WITH ME LESS THAN 1;500 FT. AGL; REQUIRING AN URGENT CLIMB AND CANCELLING OF APPROACH CLEARANCE. ALSO; DURING THE EVENT I DEVIATED APPROXIMATELY 250 FT. LOW IN ALTITUDE.DETAILS: I WAS ON IFR FLIGHT PLAN; BEING VECTORED TO ILS RUNWAY 25R. WEATHER WAS IRREGULAR SCUD; WITH A GROUND HAZE + SCATTERED LAYER WITH TOPS ~3;000 FT. MSL. VISIBILITY ABOVE WAS UNRESTRICTED; BUT LOW SUN ANGLE; WITH SUN APPROXIMATELY 30 DEGREE LEFT OF APPROACH COURSE; SEVERELY RESTRICTED FORWARD (ESPECIALLY DOWNWARD) VISIBILITY.I WAS ON VECTOR 150 DEG. WHEN I ESTIMATED TO BE 1-2 NM FROM INTERCEPT; I QUERIED CONTROLLER IF I WAS GOING TO BE VECTORED ACROSS FAC (DUE TO 105 DEG INTERCEPT ANGLE; AND STILL BEING HIGH AT 900 FT. ABOVE INTERCEPT ALTITUDE). CONTROLLER IMMEDIATELY RESPONDED WITH VECTOR 240 DEG; IMMEDIATELY UPDATED TO 250 DEG; AND CLEARANCE FOR THE APPROACH. WHILE IN THIS TURN I CROSSED THE LOC; SO I STEEPENED AND CONTINUED PAST LOC HEADING; WHILE INITIATING DESCENT TO GS INTERCEPT ALTITUDE.WHILE STEADYING UP ON LOC AT APPROXIMATELY 1-2 NM FROM FAF; CONTROLLER ISSUED A TRAFFIC ADVISORY; WHICH I DID NOT ENTIRELY COPY: HOWEVER I DID GET 'CROSSING LEFT TO RIGHT' AND 'WILL MERGE AT ZZZZZ'. I BEGAN LOOKING OUT OF THE COCKPIT; BUT ALTHOUGH I HAD GROUND CONTACT; DIRECTLY INTO THE SUN AND SCUD VISIBILITY WAS VERY POOR.WHEN I LOOKED BACK IN THE COCKPIT I DISCOVERED I WAS DESCENDING THROUGH 200 FT. BELOW INTERCEPT ALTITUDE; AND IMMEDIATELY BEGAN TO CLIMB. SHORTLY AFTER THE CONTROLLER ISSUED A 'CANCEL APPROACH CLEARANCE' AND 'CLIMB IMMEDIATELY'.AFTER LANDING; MY RIGHT SEAT PASSENGER INFORMED ME SHE SAW THE TARGET COME OUT THE RIGHT SIDE; 'DIRECTLY BENEATH' US. AT THAT POINT I ESTIMATE WE WERE APPROXIMATELY 1;400 FT. AGL; HOWEVER THERE ARE A LARGE NUMBER OF OBSTACLES (WINDMILLS) IN THAT AREA; HEIGHTS APPROXIMATELY 300 FT. THEREFORE I BELIEVE VERTICAL SEPARATION WAS PERHAPS 500 FT. OR LESS.MY SURMISE IS THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS TRYING TO CROSS THE 1;700 FT. PASS WHILE STAYING UNDER THE SCUD LAYER AT (OR LESS THAN) 3;000 FT. MSL.MY UNDERSHOOT ON ALTITUDE WAS DUE TO STILL BEING IN DESCENT CLOSE TO FAF; AND DISTRACTION WHILE SEARCHING OUTSIDE THE COCKPIT IN LIMITED VISIBILITY FOR THE CLOSE TARGET.,Pilot reported a traffic conflict on an instrument approach that resulted in a missed approach.,2019,12
556,201912,FLORIDA,DURING FINAL APP ON VISUAL APP TO RUNWAY 36L IN MCO ABOUT 1;800 FEET MSL AND ABOUT 5 TO 6 MILES OF LANDING RUNWAY; WE ENCOUNTER A DRONE ON OUR SAME ALTITUDE AND APPROXIMATELY AS CLOSE AS 50 METERS; IN OUR RIGHT SIDE AND APPARENTLY FLYING HOVER FLIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME WE IDENTIFY THE DRONE SUDDENLY IT DESCENDED AND DISAPPEARED FROM OUR SIGHT.,Air carrier flight crew reported that while inbound on a visual approach; a small drone was hovering at the same altitude within about 65 feet.,2019,12
557,201912,NEBRASKA,ON FINAL APPROACH TO LNK AIRPORT WE WERE ON THE ILS 18 UNDER VISUAL CONDITIONS; IT WAS DUSK; THE FIRST OFFICER WAS FLYING AND AS WE CAME ABOUT 100 FEET ABOVE TOUCHDOWN I NOTICED BIRDS (GEESE); I VERBALLY COMMUNICATED BIRDS AND IT WAS TOO LATE; WE HIT ABOUT TWO OF THE GEESE AND I COULD TELL THERE WAS ABOUT A FLOCK OF 6 OR SO. DURING OUT DECENT WE BRIEFED THE POSSIBILITY OF BIRDS AND WE HAD OUR EYES OPEN; HOWEVER; WITH THE DUSK SITUATION; WE DIDN'T SEE THEM TILL IT WAS TOO LATE. AFTER HITTING THE BIRDS I LOOKED AT THE ENGINE INDICATIONS AND THEY WERE ALL IN THE GREEN; THE FIRST OFFICER DID A FANTASTIC JOB FLYING THE AIRCRAFT TILL WE LANDED. WE NOTIFIED THE ATC ABOUT OUR BIRD STRIKE; THEY GAVE US A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL; WE CALLED AND TALKED TO THEM AND THEY WANTED TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE IT WAS; AND IF IT WAS CONSIDERED AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT. I TOLD THEM; THAT MAINTENANCE HAD BEEN NOTIFIED AND I WASN'T ABLE TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION; THE POLICE CAME AND TOOK OUR NAMES DOWN. I CALLED THE MANAGER ON DUTY AND HE SAID WE HAND THE SITUATION WELL. ALSO; TALKED WITH CONTROLLER AND FILLED THE PAPERWORK WITH THEM.,EMB-175 flight crew reported a bird strike on final approach that resulted in damage to the aircraft.,2019,12
558,202001,CALIFORNIA,FIRST OFFICER ADVISED OF POSSIBLE BIRD SIGHTING ON APPROACH. I SEARCHED AND SAW A BLACK DRONE 'BOBBING' UP AND DOWN TRAVELING NORTHEAST UNDER OUR NOSE. REPORTS MADE TO TOWER.,B737 Captain reported sighting a drone while on approach to Burbank airport.,2020,01
559,202001,CALIFORNIA,BETWEEN HUNDA AND LIMMA; WE SAW A DRONE GO RIGHT OVER US WHILE ON ILS FINAL.  WE TOLD TOWER.  LANDED UNEVENTFULLY.  [I] SUGGEST A DRONE RADAR.,Captain reported a NMAC with a drone on final to Runway 25L at LAX.,2020,01
560,202001,CALIFORNIA,7 MILE FINALE ON GLIDE SLOPE BETWEEN HUNDA AND LIMMA; A DRONE FLEW OVERHEAD.  REPORTED TO TOWER; LANDED AS NORMAL.  UNANNOUNCED DRONE TRAFFIC DRONE PROCEDURES MADE MORE AWARE TO PUBLIC,Pilot reported a NAMC with a drone on final into LAX Runway 25L.,2020,01
561,202001,CALIFORNIA,EMP MISSILES INSTALLED ON ALL [AIRLINE] AIRCRAFT. JUST KIDDING; THERE IS NO CORRECTIVE ACTION THAT CAN BE TAKEN OTHER THAN HOPEFULLY SPOTTING A DRONE BEFORE STRIKING IT.,Air Carrier pilot reported an NMAC with a drone while inbound to LAX.,2020,01
562,202001,CONNECTICUT,IMMEDIATELY AFTER WE BROKE OUT OF THE CLOUDS ON APPROACH; WE OBSERVED WHAT LOOKED LIKE A DRONE TO RIGHT OF THE RUNWAY 24 AT BDL. IT HAD PURPLE AND RED LED LIGHTS. POINTED IT OUT TO TOWER AND TO AIRCRAFT THAT FOLLOWED US ON APPROACH.,A320 Captain reported sighting a drone while on approach to BDL.,2020,01
563,202001,FLORIDA,WHILE ON WINCO2 SID FROM MIA BETWEEN FORKK AND BORLE AND CLIMBING THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 9;000 FEET; OBSERVED A DRONE OFF THE RIGHT WING AT APPROXIMATELY 4;000-5;000 FEET. REPORTED IT TO MIAMI DEPARTURE. I WAS ABLE TO SEE IT BECAUSE SUNLIGHT WAS REFLECTING OFF OF IT.,B737 first officer reported a UAV to departure control.,2020,01
564,202001,NEBRASKA,POSSIBLE DRONE SIGHTING SE OF AUH AIRPORT. I HAD CANCELED IFR CLEARANCE AND PICKED UP OTHER LIGHTS THAT I THOUGHT WERE AIRPLANE LIGHTS AROUND A 5 MILE FINAL FOR RUNWAY 34 AT AUH. UPON LANDING; LIGHTS FOLLOWED MY AIRPLANE INTO AIRFIELD. I HURRIED TO CLEAR ACTIVE RUNWAY AND LIGHTS TOOK OFF DIRECTLY EAST. I TAXIED TO HANGAR AND WAS CALLED NOTIFYING ME THAT LIGHTS FOLLOWED ME APPEARED TO BE A QUARTER TO HALF MILE BEHIND MY AIRPLANE. NO AIRPLANE WAS SEEN BUT BELIEVED TO BE A DRONE; UNKNOWN COLOR; BUT EXTREMELY BRIGHT LIGHTED BUT LIGHTS DISAPPEARED AS OBJECT HEADED EAST.,PC12 pilot reported UAV in AUH airport area and following pilot's aircraft while on approach.,2020,01
565,202001,NEVADA,I THE RPIC (REMOTE PILOT IN CHARGE) CALLED TOWER PER THE INSTRUCTIONS TO INFORM THEM ABOUT THE UAS OPERATION THAT WOULD BE TAKING PLACE WITHIN THE NEXT FIFTEEN MINUTES AT THE LOCATION. TOWER ACKNOWLEDGED THE REQUEST AND THE RPIC CONDUCTED THE MISSION. THE RPIC CALLED TOWER AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE OPERATION. TOWER ACKNOWLEDGED THE MESSAGE AND THE RPIC WRAPPED UP FOR THE NIGHT. SIX DAYS LATER THE RPIC REALIZED THAT HE HAD FLOWN OUTSIDE OF THE CERTIFICATE OF AUTHORIZATION (COA) BY FLYING A DAY EARLIER THAN WHAT WAS SPECIFIED IN THE COA (CERTIFICATE OF APPROVAL).THE RPIC RECEIVED A REQUEST TO FLY THE CLASS C 0' GRID AREA (PER THE FAA UAS FM) SO HE DETERMINED THAT FILING THROUGH DRONE ZONE WITH NIGHT OPERATIONS INCLUDED WOULD BE THE FASTEST WAY TO ACQUIRE THE APPROVAL. RPIC ADVISED THE FAA REPRESENTATIVE; ABOUT HIS INTENTIONS FOR ADDING NIGHT OPERATIONS WAS TO BE ABLE TO GAIN APPROVAL FASTER. THE APPROVAL CAME IN AND THE RPIC THOUGHT THE TIMING WAS PERFECT AND DID NOT CHECK THE AUTHORIZATION START DATE ON THE AUTHORIZATION ITSELF. HE MADE THE ERROR BECAUSE HE WAS EAGER TO BE ABLE TO FLY THAT AREA.THE RPIC WANTED TO GET THE PHOTOS BY DEADLINE. THE OPERATOR WAS EXCITED TO HAVE THE COA IN HAND. THE OPERATOR EXPECTED THE START DATE TO BE THE SAME DATE AS REQUESTED BUT THE FAA CHANGED THE DATE TO BE THE DAY AFTER ONLY ON THE COA BUT IT WAS STILL SHOWN AS THE REQUESTED DATE ON DRONE ZONE. DRONE ZONE SHOWS THE APPROVED START DATE AS ONE DATE AND ALSO SHOWS THAT THE MODIFIED APPROVED END DATE WAS CHANGED TO THREE DAYS LATER.,A UAS pilot operated their drone on a different day than what was approved by the FAA.,2020,01
566,202002,CALIFORNIA,ON A VISUAL APPROACH AT APPROXIMATELY 5 DME ON THE ILS 28L AT 1;500 FT.; A LARGE WHITE DRONE PASSED APPROXIMATELY 3 FT. BENEATH THE RIGHT WING OUTBOARD OF THE ENGINE. NO LIGHTS WERE ILLUMINATED ON THE DRONE. IT WAS ONLY VISIBLE DUE TO OUR LANDING LIGHTS. WE DID NOT HAVE TIME TO TAKE EVASIVE ACTION.,B737 Captain reported a NMAC with a drone while on an ILS approach.,2020,02
567,202002,CALIFORNIA,MISSED A HEAD-ON COLLISION WITH A LARGE DRONE BY AN ESTIMATED 100 [FEET] OR LESS. THE DRONE WAS STILL VISIBLE IN THE TOP OF MY WINDSCREEN AS WE PASSED UNDERNEATH. IT WAS COMPLETELY CENTERLINE TO OUR AIRCRAFT JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE OUR GLIDE PATH TO RWY 27 INTO SAN. WHEN I MADE THE REPORT WE WERE ON PATH INSIDE A MILE PRIOR TO CIJHI I BELIEVE.  THE DRONE WAS VERY LARGE AND SHAPED LIKE A LARGE GARAGE DOOR MOTOR OR A PLASTIC SHELL THAT YOU KEEP LUGGAGE IN ON TOP OF YOUR CAR.  IT WAS A SHINY; METALLIC RED COLOR WITH A CHROME SHEEN SIMILAR TO HOW COLLEGES ARE PAINTING THEIR ALTERNATE FOOTBALL HELMETS.  COULD NOT CLEARLY IDENTIFY ANY ROTORS; JUST THE SHAPE AND COLOR. IT WAS NOT A SMALL RECREATIONAL DRONE; IT APPEARED TO BE THE SIZE OF A YETI COOLER AND WE JUST MISSED HITTING IT DEAD ON...NOT A FEW FEET TO THE RIGHT OR LEFT; BUT DEAD CENTER. WE WERE ASKED THE DRONE'S DIRECTION OF FLIGHT AND RESPONDED WEST TO EAST (TOWARDS US) BUT HONESTLY IT SEEMED TO BE STATIONARY AND WAS PROBABLY VIDEOING PLANES ARRIVING INTO SAN. THE FLIGHT LANDED UNEVENTFULLY. NO DAMAGE WAS OBSERVED TO OUR AIRCRAFT POST-FIGHT.,Air Carrier Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV while on final approach.,2020,02
568,202002,CALIFORNIA,WE WERE ENROUTE TO THE RESTRICTED AREA 12;000 FT. WE RECEIVED A CLEARANCE OF 'CLEARED ALL ALTITUDES ...'. WE WERE ALMOST TO RESTRICTED AREA AND THE PILOT FLYING THOUGHT IT WAS AN IMMEDIATELY EFFECTIVE CLEARANCE AND COMMANDED A CLIMB TOWARD OUR DESIRED ALTITUDE. I WAS RUNNING THE AFTER-TAKEOFF CHECKLIST AND WAS IN ANOTHER SHELTER (NOT CO-LOCATED). THE PILOT FLYING DID NOT INFORM ME THAT HE HAD COMMANDED A CHANGE TO OUR ALTITUDE AS IS THE PROCEDURE SO THAT THE OTHER SHELTER KNOWS WHAT COMMANDS ARE BEING SENT. APPROACH CALLED AND ANNOUNCED OUR OFF-ALTITUDE CONDITION AND I IMMEDIATELY REALIZED WHAT HAD HAPPENED. THE PILOT FLYING IMMEDIATELY COMMANDED A DESCENT BACK TO THE CORRECT ALTITUDE.APPROACH PASSED A NUMBER TO CALL AND AS THE 'MISSION COMMANDER' I CALLED. I APOLOGIZED TO THE PERSON WHO IDENTIFIED HIMSELF AS THE 'LEAD CONTROLLER' AND EXPLAINED THAT THE PILOT FLYING HAD NOT UNDERSTOOD THE CLEARANCE AS HIS EXPERIENCE LED HIM TO BELIEVE THAT A FUTURE CLEARANCE WOULD HAVE HAD 'UPON ENTERING' 'WHEN ESTABLISHED IN' 'AFTER PASSING' OR SOMETHING IDENTIFYING EXACTLY WHEN IT BECAME EFFECTIVE. WE ARE BOTH VERY SORRY FOR THE EVENT AND HAVE REVIEWED OUR PROCEDURES BOTH PRIVATELY AND WITH ALL OF OUR FELLOW PILOTS AT OUR WEEKLY PILOT MEETING. WE HAVE ALSO REVIEWED THE REQUIREMENT FOR THE PILOT FLYING TO ANNOUNCE CHANGES TO AIRCRAFT CONFIGURATION SO THAT THE SHELTER NOT FLYING HAS THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS NEEDED TO KNOW THAT THE AIRCRAFT PROFILE HAS BEEN CHANGED.,UAV flight crew reported that their misunderstanding of a clearance resulted in an altitude deviation.,2020,02
569,202002,DC,DAUGHTER WAS PLAYING IN PARK WITH TOY [UAV]. PREVIOUS HOPS HAD NOT REACHED MORE THAN 20 OR SO FEET. THE TOY LAUNCHED; IMMEDIATELY ZOOMED TO 100 FEET; THEN STARTED A STEADY CLIMB TO AT LEAST 1500 FEET WHEN VISUALS WERE LOST [AS THE UAV WAS] DRIFTING WEST TOWARD REAGAN AIRPORT AND PENTAGON.,Observer reported a 'toy' UAV operated by his daughter failed to respond to controls and flew toward DCA airport at approximately 1500' AGL.,2020,02
570,202002,FLORIDA,DURING FINAL VISUAL APPROACH TO RWY 26R AT MIA; AT 1;000 FT MSL AND 3 NM FROM THE RWY; WE SAW A SMALL BLACK DRONE STATIC FROM OUR LEFT SIDE; NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS NEEDED. WE ALERTED THE TOWER ABOUT THE SIGHTING AND [THE] CONTROLLER MENTIONED THAT HE WOULD GATHER SOME MORE INFO AS SOON AS WE LANDED. INDEED; HE ASKED US ABOUT THE SIZE; COLOR; AND IF ANY EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN. WE PROVIDED THE INFO AND MENTIONED NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN. CONTROLLER ADVISED THE TRAFFIC BEHIND US ABOUT THE DRONE.,Pilot reported seeing a small drone on the left side of the aircraft at 1;000 ft MSL and 3 NM from the runway while the flight was on final approach.,2020,02
571,202002,FLORIDA,ON APPROXIMATELY 1 MILE FINAL AT AN ALTITUDE OF ABOUT 500 FT. WE ENCOUNTERED A WHITE QUAD COPTER DRONE HOVERING OFF OUR LEFT WING AT APPROXIMATELY 400 FT. DRONE OPERATOR OPERATING IN AN UNSAFE MANNER.,A321 Captain reported a NMAC with a Drone.,2020,02
572,202002,GEORGIA,IN CRUISE; LEVEL AT FL 380; WE SAW A WEATHER BALLOON ABOUT HALF THE SIZE OF A 737 WITH A LONG CABLE ATTACHED AND A LARGE OBJECT CONNECTED TO THE END OF THE CABLE; TOO CLOSE FOR EVASIVE ACTION. OBJECT PASSED APPROXIMATELY 100' TO 200' ABOVE THE COCKPIT. ATC WAS QUICKLY ADVISED AND OTHER AIRCRAFT REPORTED SEEING THE OBJECT. NO LOCATOR DEVICE ON AN OBJECT THAT LARGE? ATC HAD NO CLUE IT WAS IN THEIR AIRSPACE.,Air carrier Captain reported NMAC at altitude with a weather balloon.,2020,02
573,202002,GEORGIA,AT THE AIRPORT IN CHAMBLEE; GA; I OBSERVED THEN VIDEOED A PERSON FLYING A WHAT APPEARED TO BE AN OLDER MODEL WHITE DJI PHANTOM DRONE ABOVE TREE TOP LEVEL IN A SMALL OPEN AREA 850FT FROM THE 'CHARLEY' HELICOPTER PAD (287 DEGREES MAGNETIC FROM THE PAD) AND ABOUT 500 FT FROM THE APPROACH PATH OF RUNWAY 16 AT PEACHTREE DEKALB AIRPORT PDK. THE RUNWAY WAS ACTIVE AND IN USE BY LANDING AIRCRAFT. A STUDENT PILOT PRACTICING IN AN R22 FLEW PAST THE DRONE WHILE LANDING ON RUNWAY 16 AND APPARENTLY DID NOT SEE IT. I REPORTED THE DRONE ACTIVITY TO THE TOWER AT PDK BY TELEPHONE AND THEY WERE UNAWARE OF THE DRONE ACTIVITY AND COULD NOT SEE IT FROM THE TOWER. THE AIRPORT POLICE WERE ALSO NOTIFIED WHEN IT WAS CLEAR THE PERSON DID NOT HAVE PERMISSION TO OPERATE WHERE HE WAS FLYING. AN R44 HELICOPTER WAS ALSO FLYING OVER THE AREA AND DIDN'T SEE THE DRONE. THIS WAS ALSO A TRAINING FLIGHT. I SPOKE TO BOTH PILOTS AND NEITHER SAW THE DRONE. THE HELICOPTER WAS ALSO OFF THE CHARLIE HELICOPTER PAD. THE FACT THE DRONE COULD NOT BE SEEN BY THE PILOTS IN THE AIR IS WHAT MAKES THIS ACTIVITY SO EXTREMELY DANGEROUS THIS CLOSE TO AN AIRPORT.,Commercial drone operator reported observing a drone operating in the approach path of PDK airport and causing traffic conflict with aircraft. Tower was notified and made aware of the drone's location.,2020,02
574,202002,GEORGIA,PERFORMED INSURANCE INSPECTION FOR INSURED FOR WIND LOSS TO HOME AND BARN. UPON ARRIVAL I ASSUMED IT WAS CLASS G AIRSPACE AND DID NOT CHECK AIRSPACE. I FLEW THE MISSION WITH NO ISSUES AND LANDED MY UAS WITHOUT INCIDENT. UPON SUBMITTING OF MY MONTHLY FLIGHT LOGS TO MY COMPANY UAS DEPARTMENT; I WAS NOTIFIED OF A CLASS E VIOLATION AND WE DISCUSSED MEASURES TO CORRECT FOR FUTURE FLIGHTS. IN THE FUTURE; AIRSPACE CHECKS SHALL ALWAYS BE CONDUCTED PRIOR TO ALL FLIGHTS. WILL ALWAYS OBTAIN AUTHORIZATION TO FLY IN ANY CONTROLLED AIRSPACE THROUGH A LAANC (LOW ALTITUDE AUTHORIZATION AND NOTIFICATION CAPABILITY) APPROVED VENDOR OR APPROVED COA (CERTIFICATE OF AUTHORIZATION).,UAV pilot reported an airspace violation.,2020,02
575,202002,MINNESOTA,WHILE BEING VECTORED FOR A VISUAL APPROACH TO THE AIRPORT; ATC VECTORED US INTO A POSITION WHERE A SINGLE ENGINE CESSNA WAS 500 FT. ABOVE US AS WELL AS ANOTHER UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT 300 FT. BELOW US. I DID RECEIVE AN RA AND COMPLIED WITH IT.,A LR-60 Captain reported ATC vectored them to the final approach course and within 300 ft. of an unidentified aircraft.,2020,02
576,202002,NORTH CAROLINA,FLEW DRONE AT CLAIM INSPECTION AND DID NOT CHECK AIRSPACE. I HAVE BECOME OVER DEPENDENT ON MY MANUFACTURE GEOGRAPHICAL FENCING TO WARN ME OF ANY VIOLATION IN CONTROL AIRSPACE. COMPANY UAS DEPARTMENT DISCOVERED VIOLATION. MY CORRECTIVE ACTION GOING FORWARD WILL BE THAT I SHALL ALWAYS INCLUDE AN AIRSPACE CHECK AS PART OF MY PRE-FLIGHT PLANNING ON ALL FLIGHTS. NO FLIGHTS WILL CONDUCTED IN CONTROL AIRSPACE WITHOUT PRIOR AUTHORIZATION THROUGH A LAANC (LOW ALTITUDE AUTHORIZATION AND NOTIFICATION CAPABILITY) APPROVED VENDOR OR APPROVED COA (CERTIFICATE OF AUTHORIZATION).,UAV pilot reported a Class B airspace violation.,2020,02
577,202002,TEXAS,DURING THE DESCENT TO MC ALLEN AIRPORT (MFE) FROM 2 NM NORTH OF FATOR INITIAL APPROACH FIX RUNWAY 14 LEVEL AT 2;000 FT; [THERE WAS] A BLUE TRIANGULAR DRONE FLIGHT ABOVE THE AIRCRAFT 300 FT ABOVE THE AIRCRAFT '2;300 FT MSL.' THE CREW REPORTED THE DRONE TO MC ALLEN TOWER. VFR DAY; NO DEVIATION; NO DAMAGE; CONTINUE A NORMAL APPROACH AND LANDING WITHOUT INCIDENT REPORTED. I WAS IN THE JUMP SEAT PERFORMING A LINE CHECK.CAUSE: UNAUTHORIZED USED OF DRONE ON A CRITICAL PHASE OF FLIGHT AREA.SUGGESTIONS: MORE ADVICE TO THE PEOPLE ABOUT THE DANGER AND THE CONSEQUENCES [OF] A DRONE FLYING NEAR AN AIRPORT. WARNING SIGNS OF FLYING DRONES NEAR AIRPORTS.,Air carrier Captain reported a UAV flew 300 feet above their aircraft as it was beginning an instrument approach in VFR conditions.,2020,02
578,202002,TEXAS,I WAS THE PILOT MONITORING. APPROXIMATELY 2 NM NE OF FATOR ON THE ILS14 AT 2;000 MSL; I OBSERVED A MID-SIZED RED DRONE PASS OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT; AT AN ESTIMATED ALTITUDE OF 2;200 MSL. NO EVASIVE ACTION WAS NEEDED; AND I REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO MC ALLEN (MFE) TOWER.CAUSE: DRONE OPERATION IN THE APPROACH CORRIDOR OF RUNWAY 14.SUGGESTIONS: DIFFICULTIES IN REGULATION AND OVERSIGHT OF DRONES AND THEIR OPERATORS MAKE THIS A DIFFICULT ISSUE; BUT FURTHER EMPHASIS ON AIRCRAFT FLIGHT PATTERN AWARENESS AND THE HAZARDS OF DRONE OPERATION IN THE VICINITY OF AIRPORTS (AND EXTENDED RUNWAY CENTERLINES) MAY CONTRIBUTE TO SAFETY.,Air carrier First Officer reported a UAV passed off the left side of the aircraft while the flight was beginning an instrument approach.,2020,02
579,202002,WASHINGTON,I WAS ON ABOUT A 3 MILE FINAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 34; INSIDE THE CLASS D. A [WARBIRD] WAS INSTRUCTED TO FOLLOW ME AND REPORT ME IN SIGHT. EVIDENTLY; THE TOWER ASSUMED THAT [THE WARBIRD] WAS A CESSNA 172. THE [WARBIRD] CAME WITHIN 100 YARDS HORIZONTALLY AND LESS THAN 30 FT. VERTICALLY (AS TOLD TO ME BY THE PILOT AFTERWARDS) BEFORE HE SAW ME AND TOOK EVASIVE ACTION AND DID A LEFT 360.,SR22 pilot reported an NMAC on final to RNT airport with a warbird.,2020,02
580,202003,CALIFORNIA,ON ILS 24R APPROACH IN VMC TO LAX PASSED SMALL OBJECT AT OUR ALTITUDE 2 NM OUTSIDE THE FAF JETSA. THE OBJECT PASSED DOWN THE LEFT SIDE (SOUTH) OF THE AIRCRAFT AT CLOSE RANGE; BUT WE DID NOT HIT THE OBJECT. DUE TO ITS SIZE AND OUR SPEED WE WERE UNABLE TO TELL IF IT WAS A BALLOON OR A DRONE. REPORTED EVENT ON VHF TO ATC (LAX NORTH TOWER) AND PHONE TO [CHIEF PILOT].,B737 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV on approach to LAX.,2020,03
581,202003,FLORIDA,DURING CLIMB OUT FROM MIA; PASSING 11;000 FT.; 280 KTS.; A REFRIGERATOR SIZED OBJECT PASSED BELOW RIGHT SIDE OF FUSELAGE; MAYBE 10-20 FT. BELOW. NO SIGNIFICANT VELOCITY VECTOR PERPENDICULAR TO OUR FLIGHT PATH. OBJECT HAD NO WINGS OR FOILS AND WAS BLUE AND SILVER. NO OBSERVED PROPELLERS OR THRUST DEVICES. COULD HAVE BEEN SOME SORT OF SHAPED BALLOON BUT DID NOT APPEAR TO BE; AS IT SEEMED TO HAVE ANGULAR GEOMETRY. VERY HIGH TO BE A DRONE AND HAD NO LIKENESS TO ANY DRONE I HAVE EVER SEEN.,B737 pilot crew reported a NMAC with a large UAV.,2020,03
582,202003,FLORIDA,WHILE FLYING THE FOOXX5 RNAV ARRIVAL; WE WERE GIVEN DIRECT FADDI INTERSECTION ON THE ILS RUNWAY 19R INTO TPA. WE BROKE OFF THE STAR AT APPROXIMATELY THE DARBS WAYPOINT.UPON CROSSING THE SHORELINE AT APPROXIMATELY 5;000 FT. I NOTICED A BLACK OBJECT AT OUR 12 O'CLOCK. FOR THE FIRST SECOND OR TWO I SUSPECTED IT WAS A BIRD AND MADE A COMMENT TO MY FIRST OFFICER THAT I HAD SIGHTED A BIRD STRAIGHT AHEAD. VERY QUICKLY AFTER MAKING THAT COMMENT I NOTICED THE OBJECT WASN'T MOVING AS A BIRD WOULD.IMMEDIATELY AFTER NOTING THE STRANGE MOVEMENT OF THE OBJECT IT BEGAN MOVING RAPIDLY TO THE AIRCRAFTS 9 O'CLOCK. IT MADE THIS MOVEMENT IN A SWIFT; SWEEPING MOTION AND ENDED UP PASSING OUTSIDE OF MY WINDOW. THE OBJECT WAS FAR ENOUGH AWAY THAT I DEEMED IT UNNECESSARY TO CHANGE THE AIRCRAFTS LATERAL OR VERTICAL FLIGHT PATH. IT WAS FAR OFF THE LEFT WINGTIP OF THE AIRCRAFT; AND WE WERE MOVING MUCH FASTER AWAY FROM IT THAN IT COULD FROM US. THE OBJECT WAS HOWEVER CLOSE ENOUGH THAT I COULD SEE IT WAS A MAN-MADE MACHINE.WHILE THE BLACK OBJECT WAS ABEAM THE AIRCRAFT I COULD NOTE IT HAD THE APPEARANCE OF A DRONE. IT APPEARED TO BE A DRONE THAT USED ROTORS FOR FLIGHT. THERE WAS A LIGHT ON IT THAT APPEARED TO HAVE A YELLOWISH TINT. IT APPEARED TO MAINTAIN A CONSTANT ALTITUDE AND MOVE LATERALLY ON A LINEAR PLANE.I HAVE NEVER OWNED OR OPERATED A DRONE; BUT FROM WHAT I HAVE SEEN FROM FRIENDS AND ON THE INTERNET IT APPEARED TO BE A DRONE ONE WOULD BUY FOR PERSONAL USE. BEING THAT OUR LOCATION WAS THE NEAR THE SHORELINE I WOULD ASSUME THE OPERATOR WAS FILMING THE BEACH.,Air Carrier Captain report a NMAC with a UAV.,2020,03
583,202003,NEW HAMPSHIRE,FLYING OVER THE CITY OF LEWISTON; MAINE I CAUGHT A GLIMPSE OF AN OBJECT PASS OFF THE RIGHT WINGTIP AND LOST SIGHT OF IT QUICKLY AS IT PASSED BEYOND THE REARMOST WINDOW. THIS ALL HAPPENED VERY QUICKLY AND FOR A SPLIT SECOND I WAS CONCERNED WHATEVER THE OBJECT WAS MIGHT STRIKE THE TAIL OR ELEVATOR. AS I RECALLED THE IMAGE OF THE OBJECT IT CAN BE DESCRIBED AS BLACK IN COLOR AND THE SHAPE WAS UNLIKE THAT OF A BIRD OR CHILD'S BALLOON. FROM MEMORY I CAN DESCRIBE THE SHAPE AS HAVING EXTREMITIES WHICH I INTERPRETED AS POSSIBLY BEING A DRONE.HEARING A SKYLANE ANNOUNCE DEPARTURE FROM LEW TOWARD MY POSITION I ADVISED THE PILOT OVER CTAF OF A POSSIBLE DRONE OVER THE CITY TO WHICH HE ACKNOWLEDGED.,PA28 pilot reported a NMAC with a UAV.,2020,03
584,202003,NEW YORK,DURING DESCENT IN LONG DOWNWIND FOR ILS RUNWAY 04R; BOTH PILOTS OBSERVED A DRONE FLYING PASSED BY ON THE LEFT WING. DISTANCE BETWEEN 100-200 FT. SAME ALTITUDE.,BD700 Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV while on approach.,2020,03
585,202003,VIRGINIA,PASSENGER CAME TO THE FLIGHT DECK AFTER WE LANDED. SAID HE WORKED FOR THE FAA AND SAID THAT HE SAW A DRONE PASS ON THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT.  SAID IT WAS ABOUT 3 FEET WIDE AND A QUADCOPTER. FROM THE DESCRIPTION FROM THE PASSENGER OF WHERE WE WERE WHEN HE SAW IT I AM GUESSING THAT IT WAS BEFORE THE APPROACH. I AM GUESSING WE WERE BETWEEN 5000-3000 FEET. I INFORMED THE FLIGHT DUTY OFFICER AND BASE MANAGER WHO WERE GOING TO TELL ACT.NONE,A321 Captain reported a passenger informed the flight crew of a airborne conflict with a UAV during the arrival phase of the flight.,2020,03
586,202003,VIRGINIA,WE WERE BEING RADAR VECTORED TO RUNWAY 19C. SO WE WERE ASSIGNED A HEADING OF 070 AND ALSO DESCEND AND MAINTAIN 3;000 FT.; WHICH WE DID. ON THAT 070 HEADING WE WERE ASSIGNED AN AIRSPEED REDUCTION TO 170 KTS. THEN DESCEND AND MAINTAIN 2;000 FT. WE WERE ON FLAPS 1 AND SINCE THE CONTROLLER NEEDED US AT 170 KTS. I OPENED THE SPEED BRAKES TO HELP THE AIRPLANE DESCEND. ONE OR TWO SECONDS AFTER I OPENED THE SPEED BRAKES; WE EXPERIENCED LIGHT TURBULENCE OR WAKE TURBULENCE (I COULDN'T TELL) AND I THOUGHT IT WAS RELATED WITH THE SPEED BRAKES BEING OPERATED AT THAT TIME. I STARTED SCANNING ALL THE SYSTEMS LOOKING FOR A MALFUNCTION BUT I COULDN'T SEE ANY. RIGHT AFTER THAT AND JUST WHEN I WAS MENTALLY ENGAGED WITH THE AIRPLANE SYSTEMS THE CONTROLLER CALLED FOR A RIGHT TURN TO A HEADING 150 AND TO INTERCEPT THE [RUNWAY] 19C LOCALIZER. SO I RETRACTED THE SPEED BRAKE AND CALLED FOR FLAPS 2 ON SCHEDULE AND THEN I ASKED THE FIRST OFFICER WHAT THE CONTROLLER JUST SAID. MY MIND AT THAT TIME WAS IN DECREASING AIRSPEED TO 170 KTS. WHILE DESCENDING AND TURNING AND HOPING I DIDN'T CAUSED THAT AIRPLANE MOVEMENT. I BRIEFLY ASKED THE FIRST OFFICER 'WHAT WAS THAT'? AND HE SAID 'EITHER WAKE TURBULENCE OR LIGHT TURBULENCE' SO WE CONTINUED ON A 150 HEADING BUT I WAS HIGHER THAN WHAT I NEEDED TO BE AND I DIDN'T LIKE THE WAY THAT APPROACH WAS LOOKING SO SEEING THAT I WAS ABOUT 2 TO 3 MILES FROM INTERCEPTING THE FINAL APPROACH COURSE AND KNOWING THAT IF WE INTERCEPTED AT THAT TIME THE AIRPLANE WAS GOING TO START A KIND OF AGGRESSIVE DESCENT TO CROSS THE FIXES AT THE RIGHT ALTITUDE; I DECIDED TO LET THE CONTROLLER KNOW THAT WE WERE ABOUT TO GO THROUGH THE LOCALIZER. THE CONTROLLER SAID 'NO PROBLEM; TURN HEADING 090 CLIMB AND MAINTAIN 3;000 FT.' WHICH WE DID RIGHT AWAY THEN WE GOT RE-VECTORED AGAIN TO RE-INTERCEPT THE LOCALIZER. I KNOW IT SHOULD NOT HAD BEEN SUCH A BIG DEAL BUT WHEN YOU THINK THAT ONE OF THE SPEED BRAKES FLEW AWAY BECAUSE OF SOMETHING YOU DID (OR AT LEAST THIS IS WHAT I THOUGHT IT HAPPENED) YOUR MIND STARTS GOING A THOUSAND MILES PER HOUR. AFTER LANDING THE AIRCRAFT WAS INSPECTED AND NO DEFECTS WERE NOTICED. APPARENTLY WE HAD JUST ENCOUNTERED TURBULENCE AT THE WRONG TIME AND IT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH WHAT I THOUGHT.I'LL ADD FROM NOW ON TO MY APPROACH BRIEFINGS THAT IF WE GET TO ENCOUNTER ANY KIND OF DISTRACTION; SUCH AS TURBULENCE; WAKE TURBULENCE; BIRDS CLOSE BY OR ANYTHING OF THAT NATURE WHILE IN PROXIMITY TO AN AIRPORT TO DOUBLE CHECK WE'RE NOT MISSING ANY INSTRUCTION AND THAT WE'RE WERE WE NEED TO BE.,E175 Captain reported distractions related to turbulence resulted in a track deviation and a missed approach.,2020,03
587,202004,CALIFORNIA,TODAY I FLEW A MISSION IN CONTROLLED AIRSPACE. I WAS TOLD BY MY AIR OPS MANAGER THAT WE WERE APPROVED TO FLY IN THE AREA. BUT THE AIR OPS MANAGER FORGOT TO MENTION WE WERE ONLY APPROVED FOR 50 FEET. THE MISSION WAS TO INSPECT UTILITY POLES AND TRANSMISSION LINES. I FLEW TO A MAX ALTITUDE OF 138 FEET IN ORDER TO TAKE PICTURES OF OUR ASSET. I WAS WELL WITHIN 100 FEET OF FLYING THE DRONE. THERE WAS NO INCIDENTS AND NO AIRCRAFT IN THE AREA. I REALIZED WHAT HAPPENED AFTER WHEN CHECKING LAANCE APPROVAL TO DISCOVER THAT WE ONLY HAD CLEARANCE FOR 50 FEET.,A Drone operator flying in Class D airspace exceeded the altitude they were approved to operate.,2020,04
588,202004,CALIFORNIA,I WAS FLYING MY AIRPLANE AIRCRAFT X FROM ZZZ TO ZZZ1 AT 9500'. MY HUSBAND WAS FLYING AIRCRAFT Y ABOUT 5 MILES IN TRAIL. I WAS APPROACHING VCV AND MY HUSBAND LET ME KNOW OVER AIR TO AIR I HAD A CONVERGING ADS-B TARGET. I VERIFIED THE TARGET ON MY ADS-B AND STARTED VISUALLY SCANNING THE AREA. THE TARGET WAS APPROACHING FROM MY 10 O'CLOCK AT THE SAME ALTITUDE. WHEN IT WAS ABOUT 1 MILE FROM ME I VISUALLY SAW A PREDATOR DRONE BEING FOLLOWED BY A CHASE PLANE; A LOW WING CHEROKEE; AT ABOUT A 1/2 MILE IN TRAIL. THE DRONE AND MY AIRPLANE WERE ON A COLLISION COURSE SO I PULLED POWER AND STATED A DESCENT. I NOTICED BOTH THE DRONE AND CHEROKEE HAD ALSO STARTED A DESCENT. I ADDED FULL POWER AND STARTED A CLIMB AND THE DRONE PASSED ABOUT 200' BENEATH MY PLANE AND THE CHASE PLANE PASSED JUST BEHIND ME. I FLIPPED OVER TO JOSHUA APPROACH ON 124.55 AND HEARD THE CHASE PILOT AND APPROACH DISCUSSING THAT JOSHUA HAD ISSUED A DESCENT AT THE SAME TIME I HAD STARTED TO DESCEND TO AVOID.,Small aircraft pilot reported a NMAC with a UAV. The reporter described a chase plane following the UAV.,2020,04
589,202004,VIRGINIA,VFR PATTERN WORK AT CPK; JUST TURNED LEFT CROSSWIND. MINOR UPDRAFT WITH TURBULENCE; LOUD BANG AND PITCH DOWN MOMENT. REGAINED CONTROL OF AIRCRAFT; RETURNED TO ZZZ1 (HOME BASE). UPON POST FLIGHT; NOTICED A 4 INCH DENT ON LEADING EDGE OF RIGHT HORIZONTAL STABILIZER APPROXIMATELY 9 INCHES FROM ROOT.  SCRATCH MARKS EVIDENT INSIDE CONCAVITY AND ADJACENT (MEDIAL) TO DENTED CONCAVITY. NO RED DISCOLORATION NOTED; NO ORGANIC TISSUE NOTED ANYWHERE ON AIRCRAFT. 100% CERTAIN AN IMPACT OCCURRED IN THE PATTERN AT CHESAPEAKE; DO NOT BELIEVE IT WAS A BIRD STRIKE.,Cessna pilot reported aircraft was struck by an object during initial climb causing a dent in aircraft.,2020,04
590,202005,CALIFORNIA,WHILE BEGINNING MY DESCENT FOR LANDING AT CXP ABOUT CHIME INTERSECTION MY PASSENGER SAID 'WHAT IS THAT?' I SAW A DRONE PASS DIRECTLY OFF MY LEFT WING AT LESS THAN 50 FEET AWAY. I WAS DESCENDING THROUGH 8;000' MSL. THE OPERATOR OF THE DRONE IS UNKNOWN AND WHAT IT WAS DOING AT THAT ALTITUDE IS ALSO UNKNOWN; BUT IT WAS WHERE IT SHOULD NOT BE. THIS VERY DANGEROUS SITUATION [THAT] COULD HAVE CAUSED A TOTAL AIRCRAFT LOSS AND OR LOSS OF LIFE. I CONTINUED THE FLIGHT WITHOUT INCIDENT. I COULD NOT SEE THIS DRONE UNTIL I WAS SO CLOSE THAT ANY EVASIVE ACTION WOULD HAVE BEEN FUTILE.,C182 pilot reported an NMAC with a UAV at 8000' in the vicinity of CXP airport.,2020,05
591,202005,ILLINOIS,AIRCRAFT X WAS ON SHORT FINAL WHEN THEY REPORTED A POSSIBLE UAS AT ABOUT 1000 FEET; 200 TO 300 FEET OVER THE TRAIN TRACKS ON APPROACH END OF THE RUNWAY. THE PILOT DID NOT REPORT PROXIMITY; BUT DID NOT SOUND CONCERNED AND CONTINUED IN THE PATTERN. A P28A FOLLOWING WAS GIVEN AN ADVISORY ABOUT THE REPORTED UAS; BUT COULD NOT CONFIRM A SIGHTING. BOTH AIRCRAFT WERE SWITCHED TO A DIFFERENT RUNWAY TO PREVENT THEM FROM OVERFLYING THE AREA UNTIL POLICE COULD INVESTIGATE. NOTIFY AUTHORITIES IMMEDIATELY; ESPECIALLY WHEN IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO A CRITICAL PHASE OF FLIGHT; SUCH AS APPROACH OR DEPARTURE. FROM NOTIFICATION BY THE PILOT UNTIL THE CONTROLLER IN CHARGE CALLED WAS ABOUT 10 TO 15 MINUTES DUE TO TRYING TO GET A VISUAL SIGHTING OF THE UAS.,A Tower Local Control trainee reported an aircraft reported sighting a drone in the Tower airspace.,2020,05
592,202005,NEW HAMPSHIRE,WHILE RESEARCHING FOR A NEW DRONE THAT COULD BE USED FOR AERIAL PHOTOGRAPHY I CAME ACROSS INFORMATION REGARDING OPERATING DRONES PER PART 107 OF THE FARS. I AM FILING THE NASA REPORT BECAUSE A FEW WEEKS EARLIER I HAD OPERATED A SMALL DRONE IN AN OPEN FIELD INSIDE THE MANCHESTER CLASS C AIRSPACE. ALTHOUGH SEVERAL MILES FROM THE AIRPORT; I WAS UNAWARE AT THE TIME OF THE AIRSPACE RESTRICTIONS. THE TOY DRONE I WAS USING AT THE TIME WEIGHED LESS THEN WHAT IS REQUIRED TO REGISTER (LESS THAN 55LBS) AND DID NOT FLY MORE THAN +-50 FEET AGL FOR VERY SHORT TEST FLIGHTS OF A MINUTE OR LESS BUT ITS OPERATION WAS WITHIN THE CLASS C AIRSPACE BOUNDARY AS LATER SEEN ON A SECTIONAL CHART. LOOKING TO LEARN FROM THIS OVERSIGHT; AND AS A PART 61 PILOT; THE INCIDENT LED ME TO COMPLETE THE COURSE ON THE FAA WINGS SITE 'PART 107 SMALL UNMANNED AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS (SMALL UAS)'. FOLLOWING COMPLETION OF THE COURSE MY APPLICATION FOR A REMOTE PILOT CERTIFICATE WAS SIGNED BY A LOCAL FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR AND I WAS GIVEN A TEMPORARY REMOTE PILOT CERTIFICATE. WITH THE NEW CERTIFICATE IN HAND AND KNOWLEDGE GAINED FROM THE WINGS COURSE I AM NOW IN A BETTER POSITION TO CORRECTLY OPERATE A UAS IN THE NATIONAL AIRSPACE.,UAV operator became aware of FAR Part 107 violation after flying the UAV in MHT Class C airspace.,2020,05
593,202005,TEXAS,UPON IFR DEPARTURE FROM SJT TRIED TO PICKUP IFR CLEARANCE FROM BOTH FSS FREQUENCY LISTED AND DFW FREQUENCY. UNABLE TO GET CLEARANCE ON GROUND. AT THIS TIME LOCAL TOWER AND APPROACH/DEPARTURE CONTROL HAD CLOSED. [I] DECIDED TO DEPART VFR AND PICK UP CLEARANCE IN THE AIR. IT WAS A CLEAR NIGHT WITH NO REPORTED TRAFFIC SO DEPARTED VFR OFF OF RUNWAY 18. SET INITIAL CLIMB ALT TO 17;500 FT. AT ABOUT 10 NM NOTICED ALERT FROM IPAD THAT TFR WAS AHEAD. ENDED UP CLIPPING NW CORNER. AS SOON AS ERROR WAS NOTICED IMMEDIATE CORRECTIVE ACTION WAS TAKEN TO CLEAR TFR. TIME IN TFR ESTIMATED AT LESS THAN 20 SECONDS. TOWER/APPROACH STATES 'WHEN YOU'RE TALKING WITH US; YOU CAN PROCEED THROUGH THE TFR.' WE ARE NORMALLY TALKING TO ATC; AND ROUTINELY FLY THROUGH THE TFR WITHOUT THINKING ABOUT IT - DEVELOPED COMPLACENCY TOWARD THE TFR. TOWER/APPROACH CONTROL HAD JUST CLOSED. JUST BEFORE TOWER CLOSED; WE HEARD AN ARRIVING AIRCRAFT ASK ABOUT THE TFR; AND TOWER REPORTED THAT THE AREA WAS NOT IN-USE AND ALLOWED THE AIRCRAFT TO FLY THROUGH THE TFR.WAS UNABLE TO REACH FSS OR CENTER ON THE GROUND TO OPEN FLIGHT PLAN/TALK TO ATC. ELECTED TO DEPART VFR AND PICK UP IFR ENROUTE.HAD TFR DISPLAYED ON MOVING MAPS ON BOTH IPADS. DID NOT GET OUR ATTENTION (FACTORS: COMPLACENCY MENTIONED ABOVE; FATIGUE AFTER LONG FLYING DAY; JUST A FERRY HOME). THE TFR SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISPLAYED GRAPHICALLY ON THE AIRCRAFT'S MOVING MAP; BUT THE XM WEATHER SUBSCRIPTION RECENTLY EXPIRED. 'TFR' OPTION WAS SELECTED FOR DISPLAY BUT NOT RECEIVING XM DATA.SAW ANOTHER AIRCRAFT IN TFR; DIDN'T OCCUR TO US IT WAS A MILITARY DRONE UNTIL THEY CALLED ON RADIO. HAVING NEVER OPERATED THERE AT NIGHT; MAYBE HAD ASSUMPTION THEY WOULDN'T BE FLYING WHEN TOWER CLOSED.,Captain of a corporate jet reported a TFR violation occurred in part because their XM subscription had expired.,2020,05
594,202006,CALIFORNIA,SMALL UAS (DJI MAVIC 2 PRO) WAS FLOWN IN A RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD AT APPROXIMATELY 40 FT AGL AS PART OF A FAMILY FUNCTION. THE FLIGHT WAS A NON-COMMERCIAL OPERATION (PART 91) BUT BY A PART 107 LICENSED RPIC AT THE CONTROLS AND WITH A CRAFT REGISTERED UNDER PART 107. THE FOLLOWING DAY; UPON FURTHER REVIEW OF THE LOCAL AIRSPACE; I REALIZED THAT THE FLIGHT HAD BEEN CONDUCTED WITHIN MHR'S CLASS D AIRSPACE. AT NO POINT DURING FLIGHT WAS ANY AIR TRAFFIC VISIBLE. I HAVE NOW SUBMITTED A DRONEZONE AIRSPACE AUTHORIZATION REQUEST TO PERFORM SUCH FLIGHTS IN THE FUTURE AND WILL WAIT TO FLY IN THIS AREA AGAIN UNTIL I HAVE SUCH AN AUTHORIZATION GRANTED.,UAV operator reported unknowingly entering class D airspace.,2020,06
595,202006,COLORADO,DURING THE ARRIVAL INTO DEN; WE SAW; AT CLOSE DISTANCE; WHAT APPEARED TO BE A UAS (UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM) ON APPROACH.  I WAS PIC AND PILOT FLYING ON THIS PASSENGER TRIP. WE WERE ABOUT 7 MIN FROM LANDING. DURING THE ARRIVAL THERE WERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE AREA; WIND SHEAR; AND BUSY SIMULTANEOUS APPROACHES. NOT LONG BEFORE OUR RUNWAY ASSIGNMENT HAD CHANGED.  IN REVIEW OF THE EVENT; HERE IS MY BEST RECOLLECTION.  WE WERE ASSIGNED THE LAWGR1 ARRIVAL AND WERE INSIDE GRUBB BEING VECTORED FOR RWY 16L.  WE WERE ABOUT 200-210 KIAS AND ABOUT 9500 FT MSL. WE BOTH SAW SOMETHING WHITE IN COLOR GLINT IN THE SUNLIGHT ABOUT OUR 1-2 O'CLOCK. MY COPILOT LATER TOLD ME HE THOUGHT HE SAW IT BANK SHARPLY TO ONE DIRECTION AND THEN TO ANOTHER; UNCHARACTERISTIC OF FULL SIZED AIRCRAFT. HE TOLD ME IT WAS NOT LIKELY A MODEL AIRCRAFT AND DEFINITELY SEEMED LIKE A MULTI-ROTOR TYPE DRONE. WE BOTH SAW IT AND THE EVENT STARTED AND ENDED WITHIN 5 SECONDS. HAD EVASIVE MANEUVERS BEEN REQUIRED; LITTLE TIME WAS AVAILABLE TO AFFECT ACTUAL CHANGE. WE WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY MODEL; NUMBER OF ROTORS; SIZE OR WEIGHT.  BY THE RATE OF SPEED IT PASSED OUR AIRCRAFT; I'D ESTIMATE IT WAS WITHIN 1/2MI.  MY SIC ADVISED ATC. OUR ORIGINAL BROADCAST WAS BLOCKED. IMMEDIATELY SUBSEQUENT WE WERE GIVEN A HEADING TO INTERCEPT THE LOCALIZER AND IN HIS RESPONSE; HE ADVISED OF THE DRONE ENCOUNTER WITH PERTINENT INFORMATION. UPON LANDING WE WERE ADVISED BY GROUND TO COPY A PHONE NUMBER TO CONTACT THE TRACON. AFTER SECURING THE AIRCRAFT I CONTACTED THE TRACON; ON THE NUMBER SUPPLIED; SPOKE WITH THE SUPERVISOR; ANSWERED HIS QUESTIONS; AND LEFT MY NAME AND NUMBER PER HIS REQUEST.  AS AN AVID MODEL AIRCRAFT FLYER; I FULLY SUPPORT OUR RIGHT TO FLIGHT UAS IN A SAFE AND RESPONSIBLE WAY.  FLYING UAS AT 4000 FT AGL IN A BUSY ARRIVAL CORRIDOR IN CLASS B AIRSPACE IS NOT OK.,Light Transport Captain reported while on initial approach in class B airspace; a UAV within ½ mile at 4000 feet.,2020,06
596,202006,DC,ON A 3 MILE FINAL TO RWY 1C I NOTICED A YELLOW RPA [REMOTE PILOTED AIRCRAFT] ABOUT 2000' TO OUR RIGHT AND A FEW HUNDRED FEET BELOW US. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 12' LONG; SHAPED LIKE A BOW TIE. WE DID NOT NEED TO MANEUVER AND WERE ABLE TO LAND WITHOUT INCIDENT. LOCAL PEOPLE NOT UNDERSTANDING THE POSSIBLE OUTCOME OF FLYING THEIR DRONE NEAR A COMMERCIAL AIRPORT. LOCAL NEWS COULD REITERATE DRONE RESTRICTIONS.,Air carrier First Officer reported an airborne conflict with a UAV on final approach.,2020,06
597,202006,KANSAS,I WAS TURNING FINAL ON RUNWAY 14 AT ICT WHEN I NOTICED A YELLOW SPECK BELOW THE AIRPLANE ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE. AS THE OBJECT CAME CLOSER I REALIZED IT WAS A DRONE AND IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 100-200FT BELOW THE AIRCRAFT. I WAS ABLE TO SEE THAT ON ALL FOUR SIDES OF IT; IT HAD PROPELLER BLADES LETTING ME KNOW THAT IT WAS A DRONE. I DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE ANY MANEUVERS TO AVOID THE DRONE AND SINCE I WAS FULLY CONFIGURED AND STILL ON A STABLE APPROACH I MADE THE DECISION TO CONTINUE AND LET ATC KNOW WHAT I ENCOUNTERED.,Captain reported an NMAC with a UAV on approach to ICT.,2020,06
598,202006,MARYLAND,FLYING UP THE POTOMAC RIVER I OBSERVED A DRONE OPERATING IN MY FLIGHT PATH JUST WEST OF THE KEY BRIDGE.  TO AVOID THE CONFLICT I DEVIATED TO THE SOUTH AND MAY HAVE ENCROACHED ON THE BWI CLASS BRAVO AIRSPACE.,Pilot reported an airborne conflict with a UAV causing a possible airspace violation.,2020,06
599,202006,MICHIGAN,ON FINAL APPROACH; APPROXIMATELY 4 MILES FROM TOUCHDOWN AT APPROXIMATELY 1200 FT AGL; I SPOTTED WHAT INITIALLY APPEARED TO BE A LARGE BIRD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THE AIRCRAFT; BELOW THE GLIDE PATH.  I WAS THE PILOT MONITORING FOR THIS FLIGHT.  AS WE CLOSED; I REALIZED THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY A MEDIUM-SIZED DRONE; LIKELY THE 'QUAD-COPTER' TYPE BY ITS SHAPE; AND BRIGHT ORANGE (LIKELY WHY I INITIALLY SPOTTED IT.  IT WAS ALMOST EXACTLY ON THE EXTENDED RUNWAY CENTERLINE; AND APPEARED TO BE MOVING ON A RECIPROCAL HEADING TO THE RUNWAY (RIGHT TOWARDS US; BUT REMAINING BELOW OUR PATH; NEITHER CLIMBING NOR DESCENDING).  WE PASSED ABOVE IT; I WOULD ESTIMATE BY ABOUT 150 FEET; AND CONTINUED TO A NORMAL LANDING.  THE FIRST OFFICER WAS BUSY FLYING; HEAD DOWN WATCHING THE FLIGHT INSTRUMENTS AS REQUIRED; AND DID NOT SEE THE DRONE.  AS I KNEW WE HAD TRAFFIC BEHIND US; I NOTIFIED ATC (TOWER) OF THE DRONE SO THEY COULD WARN THE OTHER TRAFFIC.  LANDING AND TAXI-IN WERE NORMAL.  I NOTIFIED THE APPROPRIATE AUTHORITIES (INCLUDING THIS REPORT).  I WAS PREPARED; ONCE I REALIZED WHAT IT WAS; TO TAKE CONTROL AND TAKE EVASIVE ACTION; BUT NONE WAS NECESSARY.  ALSO; FROM THE FIRST SPOTTING OF THE 'PERCEIVED' BIRD; TO PASSING OVERHEAD THE DRONE; WAS BETWEEN 3 AND 5 SECONDS.SOMEONE WITH MORE MONEY THAN BRAINS (TO AFFORD THE DRONE) STUPIDLY FLYING IT IN AN ABSURDLY UNSAFE AREA AND MANNER. FIND THE PEOPLE THAT DO THIS; AND VERY PUBLICLY PROSECUTE THEM TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW.,Air carrier Captain reported flying over an opposite direction UAV while on final approach.,2020,06
600,202006,NEW JERSEY,ON 3 MILE FINAL TO RUNWAY 19 AT TEB I SAW A DRONE APPROXIMATELY 200 FEET BELOW US AND 1/4 MILE IN FRONT. WE PASSED OVER DRONE WITHOUT DEVIATING FROM LOCALIZER OR GLIDESLOPE. REPORTED DRONE IMMEDIATELY TO TOWER. HE RESPONDED THAT THIS IS SECOND SIGHTING IN 2 DAYS. MADE POLICE REPORT WITH LOCAL POLICE. DRONE WAS A TWIN ROTOR DARK COLORED AIRCRAFT ABOUT 2-3 FEET IN LENGTH. IT WAS IN STRAIGHT LINE WITH RUNWAY 19 APPROACH COURSE. IT APPEARED TO BE HOVERING THEN MOVED TOWARD US ON A 015 HEADING.,CE-560XL Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV while on final approach.,2020,06
601,202006,VIRGINIA,I WAS WORKING THE LOCAL 3 POSITION AS WELL AS CIC (CONTROLLER IN CHARGE). AIRCRAFT X; ON ABOUT A 1.5 MILE FINAL REPORTED SEEING A YELLOW DRONE EAST OF THE FINAL AT 900 FT. FROM THERE I BEGAN THE PROCESS OF REPORTING THE UNAUTHORIZED UAS EVENT FIRST VIA A REPORT. ON MY INITIAL ATTEMPT TO FILE THE REPORT; THE PAGE USED TO FILE THE REPORT WAS NOT WORKING CORRECTLY. IT ONLY ALLOWED ME TO SELECT THE TYPE OF REPORT; BUT NOT THE INFORMATION REGARDING THE EVENT. I RESTARTED THE REPORT AND KEPT EXPERIENCING THE SAME PROBLEM. AT THIS POINT; I HAD 3 ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT ARRIVING. I ISSUED EACH IT'S LANDING CLEARANCE AS WELL AS AN ADVISORY OF THE REPORTED UAS. THOSE 3 ARRIVING AIRCRAFT REPORTED SEEING NO UAS IN THE VICINITY OF THEIR RESPECTIVE FINAL. I CONTACTED THE ROC (COMMAND CENTER) REGARDING THE REPORTING ISSUE. WITH THEIR HELP I WAS ABLE TO FILL IN INFORMATION REGARDING THE UNAUTHORIZED UAS EVENT. FROM THERE; I BEGAN TO LOOK FOR THE CHECKLIST REGARDING UNAUTHORIZED UAS EVENTS. I WAS UNABLE TO FIND THE CHECKLIST AT THE CIC DESK. I WAS ABLE TO FIND THE UAS BINDER; HOWEVER I DID NOT FIND THE REPORTING CHECKLIST. I ALSO CHECKED THE ACE-IDS UNDER THE CHECKLIST SECTION AND WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND THE UAS CHECKLIST. I TRIED TO RECALL FROM MEMORY; MY CIC TRAINING ON WHAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE REPORTED. NOT BEING ABLE TO FIND THE CORRECT CHECKLIST LED ME TO NOT REPORT THE EVENT TO THE ADDITIONAL REQUIRED PARTIES. I NOW KNOW THAT I STILL NEEDED TO REPORT THIS EVENT TO THE DEN [DOMESTIC EVENT NETWORK] AND PCT; AS WELL AS BROADCAST THE EVENT ON THE IAD ATIS. IN RETROSPECT; I ALSO THINK THAT I COULD HAVE RECALLED ANOTHER CONTROLLER FROM THE BREAKROOM FOR ASSISTANCE.I WOULD SUGGEST ADDING THE UAS REPORTING CHECKLIST TO THE CHECKLIST SECTION OF THE ACE IDS. I WOULD ALSO ADD THIS CHECKLIST THE UAS BINDER FOR QUICKER REFERENCE.,A Controller working Local Control Combined with Controller in Charge reported an aircraft reported sighting a drone in their airspace but was unable to find the appropriate checklists to report the incident according to the rules.,2020,06
602,202007,CALIFORNIA,SHORTLY AFTER BEING GIVEN A VECTOR TO INTERCEPT THE LOCALIZER INBOUND ON THE ILS 26L INTO ONTARIO; CA MY FIRST OFFICER ADVISED ME THAT HE SAW A DRONE PASS UNDER OUR RIGHT WING. I NEVER SAW THE DRONE; BUT IMMEDIATELY AFTER BEING NOTIFIED FROM THE FIRST OFFICER I REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO ATC (APPROACH CONTROL). NO EVASIVE MANEUVERS WERE NEEDED; NOR ANY DEVIATIONS FROM ATC INSTRUCTION WERE NEEDED. DRONE CAME WITHIN 10-20 FT. FROM STRIKING AIRCRAFT.,Airline Captain reported NMAC with a UAV during the turn to final approach.,2020,07
603,202007,FLORIDA,WHILE DESCENDING THROUGH 10;000 FT. AN OBJECT WAS SPOTTED DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF US AND NO MORE THAN 200 FT. ABOVE US.  GIVEN OUR SPEED; WE ESTIMATE THE OBJECT WAS NOT MOVING.  THE OBJECT WAS BLACK AND RED; WIDER THAN IT WAS THICK; ABOUT A METER ACROSS.  WE SAW IT NO MORE THAN 2 SECONDS.  I HAVE SEEN PARTY BALLOONS WHILE AIRBORNE BEFORE.  WHILE IT COULD HAVE BEEN A BALLOON; ITS SHAPE CAUSED ME TO BELIEVE IT WAS A DRONE.  SEEN WHILE LOOKING OUT THE WINDSCREEN IN MY NORMAL VFR SCAN. IT WAS ABOVE US AND VERY LITTLE TIME TO REACT ANYWAY. I DON'T DOUBT THE FAA BELIEVES THIS IS A PROBLEM AND IS WORKING HARD TO MITIGATE THIS RISK.  I DON'T HAVE A GOOD SOLUTION.,Small Transport Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV while descending through 10;000 feet.,2020,07
604,202007,ILLINOIS,AIRCRAFT X CHECKED ON WITH ME LEAVING 13;000 FOR 15;000.  HE STATED THAT HE HAD A NEAR-MISS WITH A DRONE AT 11;500 FT; WITHIN 3 FT OF STRIKING ONE OF HIS WINGS.  THERE WERE NO REPORTS OF DRONES IN THE AREA; AS FAR AS I KNOW IT WAS BEING OPERATED ILLEGALLY. THERE NEEDS TO BE BETTER REGULATION REGARDING DRONE USAGE IN BUSY AIRSPACE.,ATC reported an aircraft under the controller's area encountered a NMAC.,2020,07
605,202007,KENTUCKY,SHORTLY AFTER BEING GIVEN A VECTOR TO INTERCEPT THE LOCALIZER INBOUND ON THE ILS 18L INTO CVG; I SAW A DRONE PASS UNDER OUR LEFT WING (ESTIMATED AROUND 100 FT. OF CLEARANCE). IMMEDIATELY AFTER SEEING THE DRONE I REPORTED THE SIGHTING TO ATC (CINCINNATI APPROACH CONTROL). NO EVASIVE MANEUVERS WERE NEEDED; NOR ANY DEVIATIONS FROM ATC INSTRUCTION WERE NEEDED.,Airline Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV while on a heading to intercept the localizer to final.,2020,07
606,202007,MINNESOTA,ON THE VISUAL APPROACH THE CAPTAIN AND I BOTH NOTED A WHITE OBJECT OFF THE LEFT SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT. WE WERE UNDER JUST ABOVE 1;000 FT. AND I WOULD ESTIMATE THE OBJECT WAS ROUGHLY 1;000 FT. AWAY FROM US. WE CONTINUED THE APPROACH AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. AFTER LANDING; A PASSENGER CAME FROM THE BACK AND SAID; 'DID YOU ALL SEE THAT DRONE GO BY ON APPROACH? IT HUNG WITH US FOR A LITTLE WHILE.' THE CAPTAIN REPORTED THE POSSIBLE UAV TO MSP GROUND. A POSSIBLE UAV WAS FLYING WELL WITHIN THE CONFINES OF THE CLASS BRAVO AIRSPACE.,CRJ pilot reported a Drone near their aircraft while on approach in Class B airspace.,2020,07
607,202007,NEW JERSEY,I WAS CONDUCTING A PERSONAL FLIGHT INTRODUCING A COUPLE OF FRIENDS TO GA (GENERAL AVIATION).  WE DID A FEW TURNS AROUND A POINT NEAR THEIR HOUSES AND OUR TOWN SO THEY COULD SEE EVERYTHING FROM ABOVE.  WE THEN DECIDED TO HEAD BACK TO 39N AT 2000 FT MSL FOR A FULL STOP LANDING.  ABOUT 6NM S OF 39N AT 2000 FT MSL; AT THE LAST SECOND; I SAW A BLACK OBJECT WITH FLASHING BLUE LIGHTS AT OUR ALTITUDE AND WE WERE ON A DIRECT PATH WITH IT.  MY FIRST SIGHTING OF THE OBJECT (UAS) I WOULD ESTIMATE IT TO BE LESS THAN 300 FT IN FRONT OF THE NOSE.  I LOOKED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE BIRD.  WHEN I FIRST SAW THE OBJECT; I PERFORMED AN EVASIVE CLIMBING LEFT TURN TO AVOID IT.  I BELIEVE IF IT WASN'T FOR THE SHARP MANEUVER; THIS UAS WOULD HAVE HIT THE AIRCRAFT.  THE AIRCRAFT I WAS FLYING IS EQUIPPED WITH TCAS AND THIS DID NOT SHOW UP ON IT. BEFORE FLYING; I CHECKED THE NOTAMS AND NOTHING REGARDING UAS ACTIVITY SHOWED UP.  AFTER THIS INCIDENT I IMMEDIATELY CHECKED 1800WXBREIF'S UAS OPERATING AREAS FOR THE TIME PERIOD THIS OCCURRED AND NO NOTAMS WHERE PUBLISHED FOR THIS AREA.  AFTER THE INCIDENT I WARNED OTHER TRAFFIC ON 39N'S CTAF ABOUT THE LOCATION OF THE INCIDENT.,Small aircraft pilot reported a NMAC with a UAV.,2020,07
608,202007,TEXAS,WHILE ON VISUAL APPROACH TO RWY 13L IN DAL SPOTTED A UAV INSIDE CLASS B AIRSPACE OFF OUR LEFT WING. WE CONTACTED ATC AND GAVE A VISUAL DESCRIPTION AS WELL AS LOCATION OF THE UAV. WAS DETECTED VISUALLY FROM LEFT COCKPIT. UAV OPERATING NEAR APPROACH PATH IN DAL AIRSPACE. NOTIFIED ATC FACILITY AND GAVE DESCRIPTION AND LOCATION. AS UAV OPERATIONS BECOME MORE COMMON IT IS IMPORTANT TO BE VIGILANT OF ALL TYPES OF AIRCRAFT; EVEN IN AREAS WHERE THEY SHOULD NOT BE.,Small transport Captain reported; while on approach; a UAV operating inside class B airspace.,2020,07
609,202007,VIRGINIA,DEPARTED JYO AND WAS CLIMBING TO ALTITUDE WHEN DRONE WAS SIGHTED TRAVELING APPROXIMATELY ON A HEADING OF 150 WHILE WE WERE CLIMBING ON A HEADING OF 330. THE DRONE PASSED US ON OUR RIGHT WING ABOUT 30 FEET HORIZONTALLY FROM US. CAN'T BE SURE BUT APPEARED TO BE A FIXED WING DRONE VICE A QUAD COPTER.,C172 Pilot reported a NMAC with an opposing direction UAV.,2020,07
610,202008,ALABAMA,A DRONE FLEW NEAR US ON THE RIGHT OF OUR AIRCRAFT. THE FIRST OFFICER SAW THE DRONE AND REPORTED IT OVER THE RADIO TO THE CONTROL TOWER. I DID NOT SEE THE DRONE.SOMEONE FLEW A DRONE NEAR OUR AIRCRAFT DURING OUR APPROACH TO BHM. NO COURSE ALTERATION WAS REQUIRED. WE FLEW A NORMAL LATERAL AND VERTICAL TRACK TO THE RUNWAY AND LANDED WITHOUT INCIDENT. NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY HAPPENED OTHER THAN THE DRONE SIGHTING.,Air carrier Captain reported an uneventful airborne conflict with a Drone (UAV) during approach.,2020,08
611,202008,CALIFORNIA,I WAS ENTERING RIGHT TRAFFIC FROM THE NORTH. I WAS MIDFIELD DOWNWIND WHEN I HEARD SOMETHING IMPACT MY RIGHT WING. I LOOKED RIGHT AND SAW A BLACK BLUR. I CALLED THE TOWER AND REPORTED A BIRD STRIKE. I CONTINUED WITH A NORMAL LANDING. AFTER LANDING I INSPECTED THE AIRCRAFT AND NOTICED DAMAGE TO THE LEADING EDGE AND SKIN. WITH NO BIRD DEBRIS ON THE WING; I BELIEVE I HAD A DRONE STRIKE.,Pilot believed he had a bird strike but after landing and inspecting the aircraft determined it was a collision with a drone.,2020,08
612,202008,CALIFORNIA,WHILE ON THE ILS FOR RUNWAY 25L; I SAW A DRONE PASS BY OUR LEFT WING AT POSTION HUNDA; 13.1DME. WE ADVISED ATC AT THE TIME AND FOLLOWED UP WITH THE SUPERVISOR AFTER BLOCKING IN. THE DRONE APPEARED TO BE APPROXIMATELY A 100-200 FT. OFF OF OUR LEFT WING AND BLUE AND WHITE IN COLOR; I COULDN'T TELL IF IT WAS STATIONARY AT THE TIME DUE TO THE SHORT DURATION THAT I SAW IT. NO FURTHER ACTIONS WERE TAKEN.,Air Carrier Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV while on an ILS approach.,2020,08
613,202008,CONNECTICUT,DURING DESCENT; PASSING 6;300 FT. FOR 5;000 FT. I NOTICED A REFLECTION OFF OF AN OBJECT JUST BELOW ME. I WATCHED THE OBJECT QUICKLY PASS AROUND 50 FEET BELOW AND SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF MY AIRCRAFT. THE OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A 4-PROPELLER DRONE OF SOME TYPE. THE ENCOUNTER WAS QUICK AND ONLY LASTED SECOND. WE REPORTED THE INCIDENT TO ATC AND FOLLOWED UP WITH A PHONE CALL ON THE GROUND.,Air Carrier pilot reported a NMAC with a drone.,2020,08
614,202008,FLORIDA,WHILE ON APPROACH FOR ILS 09R AT SFB; INSTRUCTOR NOTICED A SMALL BLACK DOT AT 11 O'CLOCK. WE WERE ABOUT HALF A MILE FROM THE FINAL APPROACH FIX AT 1600 FT.; FLYING AT 110 KTS; WHEN INSTRUCTOR NOTICED THE OBJECT. AS WE GREW CLOSER TO THE OBJECT; THE SUN SHINED A REFLECTION ON THE OBJECT AND THAT IS WHEN INSTRUCTOR DISCOVERED THAT IT WAS NOT IN-FACT A BIRD; BUT A DRONE; AS IT DID NOT HAVE WINGS AND FOR THE FACT THAT THE SUN DOES NOT SHINE LIKE THAT ON BIRDS. INSTRUCTOR KEPT VISUAL CONTACT AS IT WENT FROM 11 O'CLOCK AND THEN SLOWLY PAST OUR LEFT WING AT THE SAME ALTITUDE; SEEMINGLY HOVERING AT ITS SAME POSITION. DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE OF THE OBJECT; IT WAS DIFFICULT TO JUDGE HOW FAR AWAY IT WAS; INSTRUCTOR ROUGHLY ESTIMATES ABOUT 100 FT. INSTRUCTOR ROUGHLY ESTIMATES THE OBJECT SIZE WAS ABOUT 1FTX1FT. NO DEVIATION WAS REQUIRED. INSTRUCTOR REPORTED TO ATC OF THE ACTIVITY; WHO THEN RELAYED THE INFORMATION TO OTHER INBOUND TRAFFIC. FLIGHT CONTINUED NORMALLY.SUGGESTIONS: AS THERE WERE NO NOTAMS OR INFORMATION FROM ATC ABOUT DRONE ACTIVITY; THIS PARTICULAR INCIDENT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED AGAINST FAA REGULATIONS FOR UAS. SCANNING FOR BIRDS AND UAS; IN ADDITION TO OTHER AIRCRAFT; SHOULD BE CONSTANT WHEN ABLE.,GA Instructor reported an NMAC event during approach to SFB with a Drone at an altitude of 1600 feet.,2020,08
615,202008,FLORIDA,I WAS PNF (PILOT NOT FLYING) ON AN IFR FLIGHT IN AIRCRAFT X; A CORPORATE OWNED AIRCRAFT ON A COMPANY FLIGHT ORIGINATING IN ZZZ AND SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE AT DED AT XA:46. AS PNF; MY PREFLIGHT DUTIES WERE SHARED WITH THE PF (PILOT FLYING) AND MY FLIGHT DUTIES WERE HANDLING COMMUNICATIONS WITH ATC; AND CALLING OUT CHECKLISTS TO THE PF. THE FLIGHT DEPARTED ON TIME WITH ONE PASSENGER ABOARD AND WAS UNEVENTFUL UNTIL THE FINAL CRITICAL PHASE OF FLIGHT IN THE AIRPORT ENVIRONMENT OF DED IN WHICH WE CAME WITHIN WHAT I WOULD ESTIMATE WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY 200 FT. OF A SKYDIVER WHO WAS UNDER CANOPY AND PROCEEDING TO LAND AT THE DED AIRPORT.DURING THE DESCENT PHASE OF FLIGHT I HAD MADE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO SECURE THE FIELD CONDITIONS AND WEATHER INFORMATION VIA THE AWOS WHICH IS PUBLISHED TO BE AVAILABLE ON FREQUENCY. THERE WAS NO NOTAM ON RECORD INDICATING THAT THE AWOS WAS OUT OF SERVICE. HOWEVER; IT WAS IN FACT; OUT OF SERVICE. I ALSO MADE MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS TO CALL [THE FBO] ON THE UNICOM FREQUENCY TO ADVISE OF OUR ARRIVING PASSENGER. THERE WAS NO RESPONSE TO ANY OF MY RADIO CALLS ON UNICOM. WHILE STILL TALKING WITH CENTER - I DON'T REMEMBER THE FREQUENCY - I ADVISED THAT I COULD NOT PICK UP THE AWOS AND REQUESTED A WEATHER REPORT. THE CONTROLLER ADVISED ME THAT HE DID NOT HAVE WEATHER FOR DED AVAILABLE AND THAT I COULD MAKE MY REQUEST WITH THE NEXT CONTROLLER; WHICH WOULD BE APPROACH.ONCE HANDED OFF TO APPROACH; WHICH I WOULD ESTIMATE TO HAVE OCCURRED ABOUT 20 MILES FROM DED; I NOTED AND COMMENTED TO THE PF THAT THE APPROACH CONTROLLER SEEMED VERY BUSY ON THE RADIO. DESPITE THE FREQUENCY CONGESTION; THE CONTROLLER MANAGED TO GIVE ME THE WEATHER AT ZZZ1; WHICH WAS VFR. BASED ON THIS REPORT; THE PF AND I AGREED THAT WE WOULD LIKELY SET UP FOR A LEFT DOWNWIND TO RUNWAY 30 WHICH WAS THE LONGEST RUNWAY AVAILABLE. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY AFTER MAKING THAT DECISION AN UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT COMMENTED TO APPROACH THAT 'DED IS USING RUNWAY 23.' THE CONTROLLER THEN INQUIRED; 'AIRCRAFT X DID YOU COPY THAT AIRCRAFT?' I REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE AND WE THEN MADE PLANS TO OVERFLY THE AIRPORT FOR A LEFT DOWNWIND TO RUNWAY 23.AS WE WERE CONTINUING OUR DESCENT; APPROXIMATELY 7 MILES FROM THE AIRPORT; THE CONTROLLER ADVISED; 'AIRCRAFT X THE AIRPORT IS AT YOUR 12 O'CLOCK AT __ MILES; ADVISE WHEN YOU HAVE IT IN SIGHT.' I ADVISED THE CONTROLLER THAT WE STILL HAD A FEW CLOUDS BETWEEN US AND THE FIELD; AND THAT I WOULD BE MAKING THAT CALL SHORTLY. THERE WAS A SCATTERED - BROKEN LAYER AT AROUND 2;200 WHICH WAS JUST BARELY KEEPING US FROM MAKING THE AIRPORT. THEN AS WE DESCENDED AND WERE WITHIN APPROXIMATELY 5 MILES; I CALLED ZZZ1 AND ADVISED THAT THE AIRPORT WAS IN SIGHT AND WE WOULD CANCEL IFR. SHE ADVISED US THAT OUR CANCELLATION WAS RECEIVED AND TO SQUAWK VFR. I THEN ANNOUNCED OUR INTENTION OF OVERFLYING THE FIELD FOR THE LEFT DOWNWIND ENTRY TO RUNWAY 23 ON THE CTAF. WHILE I DO RECALL HEARING OTHER AIRCRAFT ON THE FREQUENCY; I DO NOT RECALL HEARING ANY OTHER PERSON ON THE RADIO ADVISING US TO CALL OFF OUR PATTERN ENTRY. WHEN WE CROSSED OVER THE FIELD AT ABOUT 1;700 FT. MSL; THAT WAS WHEN I SAW THE PARACHUTIST UNDER CANOPY AT OUR 10 O'CLOCK HIGH POSITION AT WHAT I WOULD ESTIMATE TO BE ABOUT 200 FT.I COULD TELL THAT THE PARACHUTIST HAD US IN SIGHT AND HE APPEARED TO BE IN CONTROL OF HIS RIG. WE QUICKLY ENTERED A TIGHT LEFT DOWNWIND; AND BEGAN CONFIGURING THE AIRCRAFT FOR LANDING. I MADE THE USUAL BASE AND FINAL LEG CALLS ON THE CTAF WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY OBSERVING OUTSIDE AND OUR TCAS SCREEN FOR REFERENCE TO OTHER TRAFFIC. ONCE WE HAD ESTABLISHED ABOUT A 1 MILE FINAL; WHICH IS A VERY CRITICAL PHASE OF FLIGHT I MIGHT ADD; SOMEONE UNIDENTIFIED CALLED US ON THE CTAF AND STATED 'AIRCRAFT ON FINAL; RUNWAY 23; DED; DID YOU CHECK YOUR NOTAMS?' I REPLIED IN THE AFFIRMATIVE. HE THEN STATED 'WELL YOU GUYS JUST FLEW DIRECTLY UNDER ONE OF OUR PARACHUTES AND YOU SHOULD CHECK YOUR NOTAMS.' I REPLIED 'ROGER.' HE THEN SAID 'AND JUST FOR THE RECORD WHETHER YOU CHECKED YOUR NOTAMS OR NOT THERE ARE ALWAYS PARACHUTE OPERATIONS HERE AT DED AND YOU SHOULD NOT OVERFLY THE FIELD TO RUNWAY 23.' AT THIS POINT; WE WERE ABOUT READY TO FLARE ONTO A 4;300 FT. RUNWAY AND I WAS FRANKLY DONE WITH THE RADIO DISCUSSION. MY LAST RADIO REPLY TO THIS INDIVIDUAL BEFORE TOUCHDOWN WAS 'STANDBY.' THEN WE LANDED; WAVED FRIENDLY TO THE PARACHUTISTS WHO WERE IN THE GRASS AROUND CENTERFIELD; AND ANNOUNCED OUR CLEARING THE RUNWAY INTO THE FBO.AS A PILOT WHETHER PNF OR PF; IT IS PART OF MY DUTY TO CONSIDER ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION DURING PREFLIGHT PLANNING ON AN IFR FLIGHT. THE FOLLOWING IS A DIRECT QUOTE FROM THE RELEVANT AIRPORT REMARKS FROM THE AFD (AIRPORT FACILITY DIRECTORY) AT DED PERTAINING TO SKYDIVING: 'PARACHUTE JUMPING. EXTV PARACHUTE AND FLT TRNG OPS. AVOID OVER FLYING ARPT DUR PARACHUTE OPS. TOUCH AND GO OPS PROHIBITED IF THERE ARE 3 OR MORE ACFT IN THE TFC PAT.' ETC. APPARENTLY; THE INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS SO INTERESTED IN TALKING TO ME ON THE RADIO DURING A CRITICAL PHASE OF OUR FLIGHT; BELIEVES THAT THIS REMARK IN THE AFD CONSTITUTES THAT A NOTAM HAS BEEN ISSUED THAT SKYDIVING IS IN EFFECT AT DED. IN FACT; AS I STATED ON THE RADIO; WE DID CHECK NOTAMS AND THERE WAS NO NOTAM ADVISING PILOTS THAT ANY SKYDIVING OPERATIONS WERE BEING CONDUCTED AT DED AT OUR ETA. IN FACT; THERE WERE NO NEW NOTAMS REPORTED AT DED AT ALL. THE ONLY NOTAMS IN MY FLIGHT LOG WERE FOR UNLIT TOWERS IN THE AREA OF DED. WHILE THE AIRPORT REMARKS IN THE AFD ARE ADVISORY IN NATURE; THERE IS NO PUBLISHED REQUIREMENT THAT PILOTS ARRIVING FROM THE NORTH SHOULD FLY RIGHT HAND TRAFFIC ON RUNWAY 23. IN FACT; OTHER THAN THE NOTE LISTED ABOVE THERE IS NO GUIDANCE WHATSOEVER AS TO EXACTLY HOW AN AIRCRAFT IS TO PROCEED INTO THE TRAFFIC PATTERN FOR RUNWAY 23. IT ONLY STATES WHAT YOU ARE ADVISED NOT TO DO; AND IT SIMPLY STATES THAT THESE ADVISORY REQUIREMENTS ARE IN EFFECT DURING PARACHUTE OPERATIONS WHICH I BELIEVE HAS TO BE PUBLISHED IN A NOTAM OR AT LEAST IN THE AWOS IF IT WERE WORKING.I BELIEVE THAT PARACHUTE OPERATORS AT DED SHOULD PUBLISH NOTAMS WHEN PARACHUTE OPERATIONS ARE IN EFFECT TO INCLUDE DATES AND TIMES OF OPERATIONS. I FEEL THAT THE NOTAM SHOULD MIRROR THE AIRPORT REMARKS IN THE AFD AND THAT THOSE SAME REMARKS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE ON AN OPERATING AWOS. THE AWOS SHOULD ALSO HAVE AN 'OOS' NOTAM ISSUED WHEN THE FACILITY IS OUT OF SERVICE. IN THE APPROACH CONTROLLER'S DEFENSE; I BELIEVE THAT SHE WAS DOING THE BEST JOB SHE COULD DO CONSIDERING THE FREQUENCY CONGESTION THAT SHE WAS DEALING WITH; AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T WANT TO HAVE TO ADD TO HER WORKLOAD BY REQUESTING AN IFR APPROACH INTO AN AIRPORT THAT WAS VFR AT THE TIME. THEREFORE; I BELIEVE THAT OUR IFR CANCELLATION WAS A PRUDENT THING TO DO UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES. IN FACT; I BELIEVE THAT ALL OF OUR ACTIONS WERE PRUDENT. WHILE I CAN RECOGNIZE THE FRUSTRATION OF THE SKYDIVER OPERATOR; AND I UNDERSTAND THE RELEVANCE OF THE PUBLISHED ADVISORIES IN THE AFD; IF THERE IS NOT A NOTIFICATION MADE THAT SKYDIVING OPERATIONS ARE IN EFFECT AT MY ETA; THEN I BELIEVE THAT NORMAL AIRPORT PATTERN PROCEDURES ARE PRUDENT AND SAFE. MY PASSENGER; AIRCRAFT; AND CREW WERE JEOPARDIZED BY THIS INCIDENT JUST AS MUCH AS THE SKYDIVERS WHO WERE OUT HAVING A GOOD TIME. BUT AS IS THE CASE IN MANY AVIATION INCIDENTS; THERE ARE MANY LINKS IN THE CHAIN OF FACTORS THAT LEAD TO AVIATION INCIDENTS/ACCIDENTS. USUALLY; IF ANY ONE LINK IN THE CHAIN IS BROKEN; THEN THE INCIDENT/ACCIDENT DOES NOT OCCUR. IN THIS CASE; THE LINKS OF THE CHAIN ARE NOTAMS; ATC; AWOS; AND CTAF COMMUNICATIONS. IF WE HAD BEEN PROPERLY NOTIFIED BY ONE OF THESE LINKS IN THE CHAIN; THEN THIS INCIDENT WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED. I BELIEVE THAT ALL [OF] US WERE VERY FORTUNATE IN THIS CASE AND I HOPE THAT THIS REPORT WILL HELP RESOLVE ANY ISSUES IN THE FUTURE.,Pilot Not Flying reported encountering a NMAC with a skydiver.,2020,08
616,202008,WASHINGTON,AN OBJECT; SUSPECTED TO BE A DRONE; FLEW PASSED US AT 3800 FEET ON FINAL APPROACH. WE WERE ON THE LOCALIZER AT ROUGHLY 10 MILES. THE OBJECT FLEW OVER OUT LEFT WING AS WE WERE DESCENDING. WE ADVISED ATC OF A POSSIBLE DRONE ON FINAL. NO EVASIVE MANEUVERING WAS NECESSARY. ON THE GROUND NO DEFECTS OR DAMAGE WAS FOUND.,Air carrier pilot reported encountering a drone while on the final approach course.,2020,08
617,202008,WASHINGTON,A FELLOW FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR AND I WERE LANDING AT ARLINGTON AIRPORT WHEN WE EXPERIENCED A RUNWAY INCURSION. ON FINAL APPROACH TO RUNWAY 16 WE NOTICED AIRCRAFT Z HOLDING SHORT OF RUNWAY 16 FOR TAKEOFF. MOMENTS LATER; ON SHORT FINAL OVER RUNWAY 16 AT APPROXIMATELY 50 FT. I HEARD A RADIO TRANSMISSION 'AIRCRAFT X; YOU GOT AIRCRAFT Y TAKING OFF ON 34'. THE SOURCE OF THIS TRANSMISSION IS UNKNOWN; BUT WE THINK IT WAS AIRCRAFT Z.THERE IS NO FORWARD VISIBILITY WHEN LANDING THIS TYPE OF BIPLANE; AND SINCE I COULD NOT SEE THE UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT Y; WE ABORTED THE LANDING AND EXECUTED AN IMMEDIATE GO-AROUND AT LOW ALTITUDE OVER THE RUNWAY. WE ADJUSTED COURSE TO OFFSET TO THE RIGHT OF THE RUNWAY SO WE COULD ATTEMPT TO SPOT THIS AIRCRAFT SINCE WE COULD NOT SEE OVER THE NOSE. THAT IS THE FIRST TIME WE SAW THE WHITE AIRCRAFT Y WHO WAS IN THE TAKEOFF ROLL HEADING DIRECTLY TOWARDS US. WE ANNOUNCED ON THE RADIO THAT WE WERE GOING-AROUND DUE TO OPPOSITE-DIRECTION TRAFFIC ON THE RUNWAY. WE SAW AIRCRAFT Y MAKE A LEFT AND RIGHT SWERVING TURN ON THE RUNWAY IN AN APPARENT ATTEMPT TO GET TO ONE SIDE OF THE RUNWAY AND THEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THAT WE SAW AIRCRAFT Y CONTINUE THE TAKEOFF ROLL AS HE DISAPPEARED FROM VIEW UNDERNEATH US.WE CONTINUED TO FLY A NORMAL PATTERN FOR RUNWAY 16. ANNOUNCING OUR POSITION AT EACH LEG OF THE PATTERN.UPON TURNING DOWNWIND WE OBSERVED THE SUBJECT AIRCRAFT Y FLYING UPWIND FOR RUNWAY 16. WE ASKED THE PILOT WHAT HIS INTENTIONS WERE. WE WERE CONCERNED HE MAY STAY IN THE PATTERN AND CAUSE ADDITIONAL COLLISION RISK. AN UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT; PRESUMABLY AIRCRAFT Y; RESPONDED 'RUNWAY 34 IS THE CALM WIND RUNWAY. WINDS ARE CALM! I GUESS I'LL JUST DEPART TO THE WEST. AIRCRAFT X; GIVE ME YOUR TAIL NUMBER!' THIS WAS THE FIRST TRANSMISSION THAT WE BELIEVE CAME FROM THE SUBJECT AIRCRAFT. WE CHOSE NOT TO RESPOND TO THIS AIRCRAFT; AND FOCUSED ON KEEPING THE TRAFFIC IN SIGHT; AND OUR AIRCRAFT UNDER CONTROL.MOMENTS LATER ANOTHER UNIDENTIFIED AIRCRAFT TRANSMITTED 'THE AWOS IS REPORTING WINDS FROM THE SOUTH. THE WINDS ARE NOT CALM. I'M ABOUT TO TAKEOFF ON 16'THE SUBJECT AIRCRAFT Y LEFT THE AREA; AND NO FURTHER RADIO TRANSMISSIONS WERE HEARD FROM THAT AIRCRAFT. WE LANDED SAFELY ON RUNWAY 16. AFTER TOUCHDOWN WE NOTICED THE WINDSOCK SHOWING A LIGHT WIND; 5-10 MPH; FROM THE SOUTH; FAVORING RUNWAY 16.I BELIEVE THE AIRCRAFT Y PILOT USED THE EXISTENCE OF A CALM WIND RUNWAY DESIGNATION TO ATTEMPT TO FORCE AIRCRAFT TO USE ANOTHER RUNWAY THAT WAS NOT OPTIMALLY ALIGNED WITH THE LOCAL WINDS. THIS PILOT DID NOT FOLLOW 14 CFR 91.113. IT IS CLEAR AIRCRAFT Y'S PILOT HAD AN OPERABLE RADIO; BUT DID NOT USE IT TO ANNOUNCE HIS INTENTION TO USE A RUNWAY THAT WOULD CREATE A COLLISION HAZARD. I BELIEVE THE LOCAL CALM WIND RUNWAY POLICY MAY HAVE ALSO AFFECTED AIRCRAFT Y'S PILOT'S JUDGEMENT; AND CREATED A CONFIRMATION BIAS THAT CAUSED HIM TO DO WHAT HE DID.ARLINGTON AIRPORT IS BUSY. THE AIRPORT HAS A LOCAL REPUTATION OF SOMETIMES BEING OUT OF CONTROL. SOME LOCALS CALL IT 'ANARCHY ACRES'. I KNOW FLIGHT INSTRUCTORS WHO WILL NOT LET THEIR STUDENTS GO THERE ALONE. I HAVE SEEN PILOTS LANDING ON RUNWAYS THAT ARE NOT IN USE BY THE MAJORITY OF TRAFFIC. I'VE HEARD REASONS LIKE 'IT TAKES TOO LONG TO TAXI TO MY HANGAR; SO I JUST USE RUNWAY X EVERY TIME.' THESE ARE HAZARDOUS ATTITUDES. THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY MAKES ME CONCERNED FOR THE GENERAL SAFETY OF ALL PILOTS FLYING AT THIS AIRPORT.AS THIS AIRPORT BECOMES BUSIER AND BUSIER THE FAA SHOULD EVALUATE THE NEED FOR A CONTROL TOWER AT THE FIELD TO PREVENT A SERIOUS ACCIDENT FROM HAPPENING. ALTERNATIVELY; THE FAA OR THE CITY SHOULD STUDY THE FLOW OF TRAFFIC AT THIS AIRPORT TO HELP BETTER UNDERSTAND WHY THESE EVENTS HAPPEN. THE COST/BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE CALM WIND RUNWAY GUIDANCE SHOULD BE RE-EVALUATED; ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE ARE CROSSING RUNWAYS AT THIS AIRPORT WITH A TRACK RECORD OF SIMILAR PROBLEMS IN THE ASRS DATABASE.,Pilot reported encountering opposite direction traffic at uncontrolled airport.,2020,08
618,202009,ALASKA,OUR LOA / COA WITH THE UAS OPERATORS STATES THEY ARE REQUIRED TO ESTABLISH 2 WAY COMMUNICATION AND ATC APPROVAL PRIOR TO EXITING R-XXXX. THEY ARE RESTRICTED TO THE RECOVERY ROUTE CALLED THE GREEN ROUTE; SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO REMAIN CLEAR OF 2 MILITARY AIRPORT FINALS IN CASE OF A LOST LINK EMERGENCY SCENARIO. AIRCRAFT X EXITED R-XXXX ON THE GREEN ROUTE; WITH AIRCRAFT Y IN TRAIL; WITHOUT ESTABLISHING COMMUNICATIONS AND APPROVAL WITH FAI APPROACH. THE CONTROLLER ATTEMPTED DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES; MAINS; STBYS; RTR'S; AND EVEN GUARD CALLS WITH NO SUCCESS. FINALLY; THE CONTROLLER HAD TO CALL FBK ATCT TO REQUEST THE CALL SIGN OF THE CHASE AIRCRAFT. THE CONTROLLER WAS SUCCESSFUL IN REACHING THE CHASE AIRCRAFT AND HAD THE CHASE AIRCRAFT RELAY TO AIRCRAFT X TO CONTACT APPROACH. BY THE TIME COMMUNICATION WAS ESTABLISHED; AIRCRAFT X WAS 8.59 MILES OUTSIDE OF R-XXXX; INBOUND TO FBK ON THE GREEN ROUTE. FOLLOW THE COA / LOA; OR UPDATE IT WITH MORE CURRENT OPERATIONS SINCE IT IS OVER 2 YEARS OLD.,ATC reported a loss of communication with a UAV and its chase aircraft.,2020,09
619,202009,WISCONSIN,AIRCRAFT X WAS GIVEN TAKEOFF CLEARANCE AND UPON TAKEOFF ROLL REPORTED AN ABORTED TAKEOFF DUE TO POSSIBLE BIRD STRIKE. AFTER EXITING THE ACTIVE RUNWAY THEY STOPPED TO DO A SYSTEMS CHECK AND AIRCRAFT EVALUATION. THEY THEN REQUESTED THAT THE FIRE DEPARTMENT FOLLOW THEM TO THE GATE IN CASE OF POSSIBLE HOT BRAKES. I ALERTED THE FIRE DEPARTMENT AND THEY FOLLOWED THE AIRCRAFT TOWARD THE GATE. AT THAT TIME THE FIRE CHIEF ADVISED THAT THE AIRCRAFT NEEDED TO BE EVALUATED BEFORE THEY COULD BE ALLOWED TO GO TO THE GATE. I GAVE THEM A HOLDING AREA ON AN UNUSED TAXIWAY. AT THAT TIME IT WAS DETERMINED THAT IT WAS A HOT BRAKES SITUATION AND THE COUNTY DECLARED IT AN ALERT 2 SITUATION. FIRE TRUCKS WERE ALREADY ON SCENE. VISUAL INSPECTION BY FIRE DEPARTMENT PERSONNEL ALSO DISCOVERED ENGINE DAMAGE FROM THE BIRD STRIKE. AFTER THE BRAKES HAD COOLED ENOUGH THE AIRCRAFT TAXIED TO THE GATE. NO ONBOARD INJURIES WERE REPORTED. ALERT 2 WAS CANCELED BY COUNTY UPON AIRCRAFT REACHING THE GATE.,Air carrier Captain and Local Controller reported a high speed rejected takeoff was performed after the aircraft experienced two bird strikes.,2020,09
620,202010,ARIZONA,I WAS IN CRUISE PHASE ON THE FLIGHT; FROM ZZZ TO ZZZ1. AROUND YUMA THERE WAS AN OBJECT IN THE AIR WHICH ME AND MY PASSENGER COULDN'T IDENTIFY BUT SEEMED LIKE A BALLOON WITH A HUMAN SIZE GRAY COLOR METAL PART AT THE SAME ALTITUDE. WE PASSED VERY CLOSE BY; IT WAS SCARY AND SINCE IT WAS A RELATIVELY SMALL OBJECT I COULDN'T SEE IT FROM VERY FAR; SO I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH TIME TO REACT. IT WASN'T MOVING IN HORIZONTAL (NOT 100% SURE ABOUT HORIZONTAL) OR VERTICAL SPACE. ALSO DIDN'T APPEAR ON STRATUX OR GPS. I WAS ON FLIGHT FOLLOWING; SO I IMMEDIATELY COMMUNICATED WITH THE ATC AND SHARED DETAILS. 2 DAYS AFTER THIS INCIDENT; WE WERE ON THE WAY BACK TO ZZZ; EXACTLY SAME HAPPENED AROUND THE SAME AREA; REPORTED AGAIN TO ATC THE SAME WAY. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE THIS TIME WAS; IT WAS [A] LITTLE SMALLER. FEW DAYS AGO; SINCE I'M CURRENTLY IN IFR TRAINING I SHARED MY EXPERIENCE WITH MY CFII EXCEPT GIVING THE LOCATION BUT THE DESTINATION; HE IMMEDIATELY ASKED IF THIS HAPPENED AROUND YUMA AND I WAS SURPRISED WITH HIS QUESTION. HE IS NOT SURE WHAT THE OBJECT IS EITHER; BUT OBVIOUSLY I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE SEEING THESE. SO WANTED TO CREATE THIS REPORT SINCE I THINK IT'S A HIGH POTENTIAL DANGER ESPECIALLY IF THAT WOULD BE AN IFR FLIGHT.,Private pilot reported an encounter with a large stationary balloon while in cruise flight near Yuma; AZ.,2020,10
621,202010,LOUISIANA,I WAS OPERATING ON AN IFR FLIGHT PLAN WHILE VMC IN CRUISE TALKING TO BATON ROGUE APPROACH EN-ROUTE TO HOUSTON. I WAS CRUISING AT 140 KNOTS TRUE WITH THE AUTOPILOT ENGAGED TRACKING DIRECT TO LFT. THE EVENT OCCURRED AT 6;000 FT. I WAS SCANNING OUTSIDE THE WINDSCREEN WHEN OUT OF THE CORNER OF MY EYE I SAW A BLACK OBJECT THROUGH THE COPILOT'S SIDE WINDSHIELD. MY FIRST REACTION WAS A BIRD AND IT WAS TOO LATE TO AVOID. THE OBJECT PASSED BENEATH MY WING AND I BRIEFLY LOST LINE OF SIGHT BEFORE THE OBJECT REAPPEARED BEHIND THE STARBOARD WING. AT THIS MOMENT; I IDENTIFIED THAT THE OBJECT WAS NOT A BIRD AND HAD FOUR ARMS; ROTORS; AND WAS A LARGE; BUT STANDARD LOOKING QUAD COPTER STYLE UAS WITH POSITION LIGHTS. I ESTIMATED THAT THE OBJECT PASSED WITH 50-150 FEET OF THE AIRCRAFT AND VARIED IN ALTITUDE. IT RAPIDLY CHANGED COURSES AND AS I PASSED THE UAS IT MADE A SHARP TURN AND A RAPID ACCELERATION BEHIND THE AIRCRAFT'S TAIL AND OUT OF SIGHT. NO FURTHER CONTACT WAS MADE. I IMMEDIATELY CONTACTED ATC AND REPORTED THE EVENT. ATC CONTACTED ME TO FOLLOW UP ABOUT 5 MINUTES AFTER I REPORTED TO THEM AND I RELAYED THE COORDINATES AND DESCRIPTION OF THE UAS TO THEM. THE FLIGHT CONTINUED SAFELY TO ITS DESTINATION. WHILE I ALSO HOLD A UAS CERTIFICATE AND ENJOY THAT SIDE OF AVIATION; THIS NEAR MID-AIR COLLISION WAS EXTREMELY UNFORTUNATE. THERE SEEMS TO BE VERY LITTLE ENFORCEMENT IN THIS AREA OF AVIATION. A COLLISION WOULD HAVE LIKELY RESULTED IN AN IN FLIGHT BREAKUP. AS A MANNED PILOT; I DO NOT BELIEVE THERE IS MUCH I COULD HAVE DONE TO AVOID THIS. I COULD COACH MY UAS FRIENDS IN THE LAW; BUT MOST OF MY PEERS ARE WELL VERSED AND FOLLOW THE REGULATIONS. IT ONLY TAKES ONE ROGUE INDIVIDUAL TO CAUSE AN ISSUE. I ALSO THOUGHT I MIGHT OPT TO FLY AT HIGHER ALTITUDES. I HAD CHOSEN 6;000 FOR WIND AND VISIBILITY; BUT PERHAPS I SHOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER. I DO NOT BELIEVE THIS IS A COMPELLING ARGUMENT BECAUSE SOME DRONES CAN CLIMB TO THE FLIGHT LEVELS...MUCH HIGHER THAN A PISTON GA. I THINK DRONES MAY NEED TO HAVE FURTHER HARDWARE LIMITATIONS (SUBJECT TO OVERRIDES) THAT WOULD KEEP THEM OFF OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS OR ON ADSB/RADAR IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF MANNED FLIGHT.,General Aviation Pilot reported NMAC with drone during cruise while in contact with BTR TRACON.,2020,10
622,202010,MASSACHUSETTS,I OBSERVED A DRONE WHILE ON FINAL FOR RUNWAY 4R; ABOUT 3 NM OUT OF BOS AT 1;200 FT. THE PREVIOUS AIRCRAFT (COMPANY) ALSO REPORTED THAT AN UNKNOWN OBJECT WAS FLYING IN THE AREA. I SAW A SILVER DRONE FLYING AT A DECENT SPEED AROUND RUNWAY 4R'S FINAL APPROACH PATH. I CONTINUED THE APPROACH AND DID NOT HAVE TO MANEUVER TO AVOID THE DRONE BECAUSE IT WAS VISIBLE AND AT A REASONABLE DISTANCE. THE UNAUTHORIZED DRONE WAS FLYING WITHIN THE INNER SHELF OF THE BOSTON CLASS B AIRSPACE. SUGGEST CREATING MORE AWARENESS OF THE RESTRICTIONS ON UAS OPERATION AROUND BUSY CLASS BRAVO AIRSPACE.,Captain reported sighting a drone while on final approach to BOS airport.,2020,10
623,202010,NORTH CAROLINA,ON 2 TO 3 MILE FINAL AND AT 2500 FEET I SAW WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A BIRD. I WAS PILOT MONITORING AND ADVISED THE FIRST OFFICER THE PILOT FLYING OF LOCATION 11 O'CLOCK AND ABOVE. AS WE GOT CLOSER I BELIEVED IT TO BE A DRONE THAT PASSED LEFT TO RIGHT AND 3 TO 400 FEET ABOVE US. I REPORTED ALTITUDE A DISTANCE ON FINAL TO TOWER. IT APPEARED TO BE ABOUT THE SIZE OF A LARGE BIRD AND DARK GRAY OR BLACK IN COLOR.,Air Carrier Captain reported a NMAC with a Drone on short final.,2020,10
624,202010,TEXAS,DESCENDING VIA THE ARRIVAL WE WERE CLEARED DIRECT TO INTERCEPT THE LOCALIZER; DESCEND AND MAINTAIN 6000 FEET. AS WE APPROACHED THE LOCALIZER AT 6000 FEET WE CALLED THE AIRPORT IN SIGHT AND ATC CLEARED US FOR THE VISUAL APPROACH. AS THE FIRST OFFICER STARTED A DESCENT; I WAS LOOKING FOR THE TRAFFIC AHEAD OF US AS INDICATED ON TCAS ON THE SAME APPROACH WHEN I SAW A GLINT OF LIGHT AT 12:00 LEVEL WITH US AND VERY CLOSE. AS WE WERE DESCENDING BELOW 6000 FEET WE SAW VERY CLEARLY A BLACK; FOUR-ROTOR DRONE WITH A FLASHING RED LIGHT AND CAMERA HUNG BELOW PASS 100 TO 200 FEET OFF OUR LEFT WING NEARLY LEVEL WITH US. WE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED IT TO ATC AS THERE WERE PLANES LINED UP BEHIND US ON THE APPROACH. AFTER LANDING GROUND CONTROL GAVE US A NUMBER AND WE HAD A TELEPHONE CONVERSATION WITH THE TOWER ABOUT THE NEAR-MISS. SOMEONE FLYING THEIR DRONE TOO HIGH AND ON THE APPROACH PATH. TRYING TO GET VIDEO OF PASSING AIRLINERS FOR THEIR INSTAGRAM? CAN WE INSTALL JAMMERS THAT COULD PREVENT THEIR REMOTE CONTROLS FROM WORKING NEAR THE AIRPORT?,An Air Carrier pilot reported a Near Mid Air Collision with a Drone.,2020,10
625,202011,CALIFORNIA,WE WERE ON FINAL FOR RUNWAY 25L WHEN WE NOTICED WHAT WE BELIEVED TO BE A DRONE FLYING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTION AND TOWARDS US.I TOOK THE AIRPLANE AND APPLIED POSITIVE INPUT TO ROLL THE AIRPLANE INTO 30-35 DEGREES OF BANK TO THE LEFT. WE CLEARED A NOW-IDENTIFIED CLUSTER OF ABOUT 20 BALLOONS.I HAVE ENCOUNTERED AND REPORTED DRONES ON FINAL IN THE PAST; AND I ADMIT I AM SENSITIVE TO THE SUBJECT.THE MANEUVER WAS NOT VERY MUCH MORE THAN AN S-TURN EXCEPT FOR THE RATE OF BANK.,Air carrier Captain reported taking an evasive maneuver after identifying what they believed was a UAV traveling in the opposite direction towards them while on approach to LAX airport. Captain stated it was actually a cluster of balloons; but that they have had encounters with UAVs in the past.,2020,11
626,202011,FLORIDA,I WAS PRACTICING LANDINGS IN THE PATTERN AT SPRUCE CREEK WITH THE WINDS FAVORING RUNWAY 24.I WAS ON LEFT BASE LEG DESCENDING THROUGH 600 FT. WHEN; IN MY PERIPHERAL VISION; I THOUGHT I SAW A LARGE BIRD DIRECTLY OFF MY LEFT SIDE. I SHIFTED MY FOCUS TOWARD IT AND REALIZED THAT IT WAS A DRONE WITH 4 ROTORS JUST ABOUT AT MY ALTITUDE CLOSE OFF MY LEFT WING.I RESUMED MY PATTERN AND LANDED. I THEN CAUTIONED ANYONE ON THE FREQUENCY ABOUT THE DRONE.WHAT REALLY CONCERNED ME IS WHAT HAPPENED NEXT. I TRIED TO REPORT THIS TO THE ORLANDO FSDO. I MADE THREE PHONE CALLS AND THEY COULD HAVE CARED LESS. I GOT A CALL BACK THE NEXT WEEK AND THEY SAID AN INSPECTOR WOULD CALL AND GET A STATEMENT. NOBODY EVER BOTHERED. IT HAS BEEN OVER A MONTH AND THEY NEVER FOLLOWED UP. IS THERE SOME SORT OF REGISTRY FOR AIRPLANE AND DRONE NEAR MISSES? HOW CAN THE FAA KNOW IF THESE NEAR MISSES ARE HAPPENING IF THEY WON'T RECORD THEM? THE FAA SHOULD BE GATHERING DATA ON THIS. HOPEFULLY; NASA ASRS WILL.,Pilot of single engine aircraft was on base leg of approach and had a near miss with a multi rotor drone. Reporter was upset they never heard back from the local FSDO.,2020,11
627,202011,HAWAII,HNL ATIS [IS] SO LONG NO ONE ACTUALLY LISTENS TO IT. FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS I HAVE LISTENED TO HNL ATIS THOUSANDS OF TIMES. IT IS THE WORST AND LONGEST ATIS I HAVE EVER HEARD AND THE ULTRA-LONG; DRONING VOICE WITH REDUNDANT; USELESS INFORMATION CREATES CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH A PILOT CAN'T LISTEN TO AND UNDERSTAND THE WHOLE THING EVEN IF HE TRIED. I HAVE TIMED THE ATIS BROADCAST SEVERAL TIMES AND IT'S ALWAYS OVER 2 MINUTES IN LENGTH. THIS REPRESENTS ABOUT 5 NM TRAVELED IN A SMALL AIRCRAFT; AND PROBABLY DOUBLE THAT IN AN AIRLINER. ADDITIONALLY; MOST OF THE INFORMATION IS USELESS OR SUFFERS FROM POOR QUALITY CONTROL.EXAMPLES:-LISTING ALL LIGHTING INOPERATIVE FOR A RUNWAY THAT IS CLOSED; IN THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY.-WAY TOO MUCH TIME SPENT ON TAXIWAYS OUT OF SERVICE.-DUPLICATION OF INFORMATION LIKE 'LAHSO IN EFFECT' SPOKEN TWICE.-'TAXIWAY RELATIVE HUMIDITY OUT OF SERVICE' REFERRING TO TAXIWAY RH.-'MEN AND EQUIPMENT WORKING ALL TAXIWAYS AND RUNWAYS' HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON THE ATIS.-'INCREASED BIRD STRIKE HAZARD ALL RUNWAYS' HAS ALWAYS BEEN ON THE ATIS.NOBODY LISTENS TO THIS. I HAVE TRIED TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE WHOLE THING AND IT'S DAMN DIFFICULT EVEN ON THE GROUND. LAST YEAR WHEN THERE WERE MORE RUNWAY CLOSURES THERE WERE EVENTS WHERE AIRCRAFT OVERRAN CLOSED SECTIONS OF RUNWAY AND I BELIEVE ATIS WAS PRIMARILY TO BLAME.IDEAS TO MAKE THIS BETTER:-GET A FASTER TALKING ROBOT; OR MAKE A HUMAN RECORD IT (THAT WILL ELIMINATE SOME ERRORS).-MOVE INFORMATION THAT'S ALWAYS ON THERE (LIKE THE BIRD STRIKE THING) TO THE CHART SUPPLEMENT.-CONSOLIDATE GROUPS OF INFORMATION; LIKE 'TAXIWAYS CLOSED: B; D; F; RH; RB'.-MAYBE MAKE A SEPARATE FREQUENCY WITH A 'LONG ATIS' FOR OUT OF TOWNERS WHO WANT TO HEAR ABOUT HOW BAD THE BIRD STRIKE HAZARD IS GETTING.WE HAVE A 20 MIN LEG FROM ZZZ. THIS ENSURES THAT 10% OF THE FLIGHT WILL BE SPENT LISTENING TO HNL'S ATIS. PLEASE MAKE THE FAA FIX THIS.,Pilot reported the HNL ATIS as very lengthy; repetitive; outdated; and of poor quality.,2020,11
628,202011,ILLINOIS,WHILE ON APPROACH TO RUNWAY 28C; ORD ABOUT 1 MILE TO SEIKA (FAF); NOTICED OBJECT MOVE RAPIDLY THROUGH MY FIELD OF VISION FROM THE FRONT TO THE LEFT AS WE WENT PAST IT. OBJECT APPEARED TO BE A QUADCOPTER UAV AND WAS AT OUR ALTITUDE (APPROXIMATELY 2;500 FT MSL). IT HAPPENED VERY RAPIDLY AND I DID NOT HAVE TIME TO REACT TO THE OBJECT UNTIL IT WAS PAST THE LEFT WING.,Flight crew reported an uneventful airborne conflict with a drone during initial approach.,2020,11
629,202011,ILLINOIS,APPROACH GAVE US A HEADING TO INTERCEPT THE 28C LOCALIZER.  CAPTAIN TURNED TO THAT HEADING BUT DIDN'T NOT SELECT A DIFFERENT NAV MODE.  I ASSUMED HE WAS WAITING FOR WINGS LEVEL TO SELECT NAV.  AT WINGS LEVEL; HE DID NOTHING SO I ASKED IF WE WERE CLEARED FOR THE APPROACH.  HE THANKED ME AND SELECTED NAV.  AT THAT POINT I BELIEVE WE WERE TOO FAR TO INTERCEPT THE COURSE.  APPROACH ASKED IF WE WERE GOING THROUGH COURSE.  THEY GAVE US A HEADING TO THE SOUTH TO REINTERCEPT.  CAPTAIN LEFT AUTOPILOT ON AND THE AIRCRAFT WAS SLOW TURNING AND I DIDN'T TAKE THE PLANE AND TURN THE AUTOPILOT OFF.  APPROACH CALLED TRAFFIC 1;000 FT ABOVE ON THE 27L APPROACH.  WE HAD THE TRAFFIC AND WERE GIVEN AN ADDITIONAL TURN SOUTH; AND DECENT TO 4;000 FT AND RECLEARED FOR THE VISUAL FOR 28C. [REPORTER STATED A CONTRIBUTING] CAUSE WAS END OF A 4 DAY TRIP AND WE WERE TIRED.  ALSO; WE HAD MORE DISCUSSION IN STERILE [COCKPIT] THAN NORMAL AS AN AIRCRAFT AHEAD OF US HAD REPORTED A DRONE APPROXIMATELY 400 FT BELOW THEM ON FINAL.  I WAS UNCERTAIN WHICH AIRCRAFT THIS WAS RELATIVE TO OUR POSITION ON THE APPROACH; SO WE WERE DISCUSSING THAT. [REPORTER RESOLVES TO] PAY CLOSER ATTENTION.  DISENGAGE AUTOPILOT TO CORRECT MORE QUICKLY.,Air carrier First Officer reported approach clearance deviation resulting in ATC assigned vectors to restart the approach for an uneventful landing.,2020,11
630,202011,MINNESOTA,DEPARTED FCM ON A VFR CLIMB TO THE SOUTH.  CLIMBING THROUGH 2300 [FEET] WE SAW AN OBJECT (LOOKED LIKE AND AIRCRAFT) WE ASSUMED AN AIRCRAFT POTENTIALLY ON DOWNWIND FOR RUNWAY 28L AT FCM.  WE ADJUSTED OUR FLIGHT PATH TO PASS TO THE RIGHT OF THE OBJECT.  NO INDICATIONS ON ADS-B. AS WE GOT CLOSER WE WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE OBJECT AS A LARGE DRONE WITH 4 ROTORS. THE DRONE WAS STATIONARY AS WE FLEW PITHING 2000 FEET HORIZONTALLY.  WE IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THIS TO THE FCM TOWER.,Flight Instructor reported taking evasive action to avoid a drone.,2020,11
631,202011,NORTH CAROLINA,I WAS THE PM; CA WAS FLYING. AT ABOUT 7;100 MSL WHILE BEING VECTORED ON THE NE SIDE OF CLT AIRPORT FOR RUNWAY 36R (CROSS SIDE RUNWAY) WE NOTICED A DRONE OFF OUR RIGHT SIDE ABOUT 1-2 O'CLOCK POSITION; PASSING BY OFF OUR RIGHT SIDE.  IT WAS CLOSE ENOUGH TO DISTINGUISH IT WAS A 4 PROPELLER DRONE. IT WAS HARD TO DETERMINE EXACTLY HOW FAR AWAY THE DRONE WAS BUT MY GUESS WOULD BE WITHIN A FEW HUNDRED FEET. AS WE PASSED BY IN OUR DESCENT WE APPEARED TO BE SLIGHTLY BELOW IT AS WE PASSED. WE NOTIFIED ATC AND CONTINUED THE APPROACH TO LANDING UNEVENTFULLY.AT FIRST I THOUGHT IT WAS A BIRD UNTIL I QUICKLY REALIZED IT WAS A DRONE. I KEPT MY EYES ON IT AS LONG AS I COULD AS WE PASSED BY. THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT WAS A DRONE. CAUSE WAS DRONE FLYING IN CLASS BRAVO AIRSPACE NEAR CLT AT AN ALTITUDE HIGH ENOUGH TO BE IN THE WAY OF COMMERCIAL AIRLINE TRAFFIC. WE WERE BEING VECTORED FROM THE NW TO THE NE SIDE OF CHARLOTTE AIRPORT FOR RUNWAY 36R. I NOTIFIED THE CA WHEN I FIRST SAW SOMETHING; AND HE TOO SAW THE DRONE. WE DID NOT MAKE ANY ALTITUDE OR COURSE CHANGES AS IT HAPPENED TOO QUICKLY AND THE DRONE WAS NOT IN OUR IMMEDIATE FLIGHT PATH.,Air carrier Captain reported an airborne conflict with a drone during approach to CLT airport.,2020,11
632,202011,TEXAS,I DEPARTED 52F FROM RUNWAY 35 FOR A STRAIGHT OUT VFR CLIMB ENROUTE TO ZZZ FOR PATTERN WORK. AFTER DEPARTURE; AND DURING THE INITIAL CLIMB; I VISUALLY OBSERVED A POWERED PARACHUTE MANEUVERING AT APPROXIMATELY 1;200 FEET MSL ON THE EXTENDED STRAIGHT OUT DEPARTURE PATH FROM 52F.  I THEN OBSERVED A SECOND POWERED PARACHUTE OPERATING AT MY CURRENT ALTITUDE OF 1;500 FEET MSL DIRECTLY IN MY FLIGHT PATH (ALTITUDES LATER CROSSCHECKED FROM MY FOREFLIGHT FLIGHT PATH REPLAY). SINCE THE SECOND POWERED PARACHUTE WAS HEAD-ON I DID NOT SEE HIM UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE.  I WAS FORCED TO MAKE AN ABRUPT MANEUVER TO THE LEFT (WEST) TO AVOID A MIDAIR COLLISION.  I HAVE SINCE LEARNED FROM OTHER PILOTS BASED AT 52F THAT THIS IS A FREQUENT OCCURRENCE IN ALL AREAS AROUND 52F; AND AT TIMES POWERED PARACHUTES HAVE OPERATED WITHIN THE LATERAL AND VERTICAL TRAFFIC PATTERN BOUNDARIES OF 52F; WHICH SEEMS TO BE CONTRARY TO 14 CFR PART 103.13(A) AND (B).  IN ADDITION; THIS TYPE OF OPERATION IS PROHIBITED AT 52F PER THE REMARKS SECTION OF THE A/FD.  THESE TYPES OF OPERATIONS ARE LESS REGULATED THAN DRONES AND DRONE OPERATORS.  I AM CONCERNED THAT IF ALLOWED TO CONTINUE WITHOUT SOME TYPE OF MITIGATION OR FAA INTERVENTION THAT IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME BEFORE THERE IS AN ACCIDENT. I WOULD SUGGEST EITHER REQUIRING SOME KIND OF FORMAL TRAINING/TESTING/CHECKING FOR POWERED PARACHUTES OR PROHIBITING THESE OPERATIONS UNDER (NOT JUST WITHIN) THE ALL CLASS B AIRSPACE.,GA pilot reported a NMAC with a powered parachute at 52F airport. Reportedly; this is a common occurrence around this airport.,2020,11
633,202011,TEXAS,WE WERE WAITING TO TAKE OFF. THE AIRCRAFT THAT TOOK OFF AHEAD OF US REPORTED HITTING BIRDS ON TAKE OFF. THE CONTROLLER ASKED IF THEY HIT THE BIRDS DIRECTLY OVER THE RUNWAY; THE CREW CONFIRMED IT WAS. WE WERE NEXT FOR TAKEOFF WHEN THE CONTROLLER ASKED IF WE HAD HEARD THE REPORT FROM THE AIRCRAFT AHEAD. WE SAID WE DID. TOWER THEN DELIVERED A CAUTION ABOUT POSSIBLE FOD (FOREIGN OBJECT DEBRIS) AND BIRDS ON THE RUNWAY AND CLEARED US FOR TAKEOFF. WE REFUSED THE CLEARANCE AND ASKED THAT THE RUNWAY BE INSPECTED. WE WERE THEN INFORMED THAT IT WOULD TAKE A LONG TIME FOR AN INSPECTION; WE SAID WE WILL WAIT. THIS SEEMED TO AGGRAVATE THE CONTROLLER. TOWER CONTINUED TO GIVE TAKEOFF CLEARANCES UNTIL EVENTUALLY NO ONE WANTED TO GO UNTIL THE RUNWAY WAS INSPECTED. THIS SEEMED TO EXPEDITE THE RUNWAY GETTING INSPECTED. ONCE IT WAS DEEMED SAFE AND FREE FROM FOD; TAKEOFFS RESUMED.I THEN REACHED OUT TO AN AIRPORT AUTHORITY AND THEIR ATC GROUP. THEY INFORMED ME THAT THEY HAVE AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE ATC AND THE AIRPORT AUTHORITY ABOUT SUCH EVENTS. IF AT THEIR AIRPORT THAT SAME REPORT WAS MADE ON TAKEOFF THEY STATED THE RUNWAY WOULD HAVE BEEN CLOSED FOR AN INSPECTION. THEY ALSO STATED IT TAKES LESS THAN 5 MINUTES AT DFW I WAITED LONGER THAN THAT DUE TO REFUSING THE TAKEOFF CLEARANCE.I THEN TOOK THE QUESTION TO THE APA NATIONAL SAFETY COMMITTEE AND ASKED WHAT THEY KNEW ABOUT PROCEDURE WHEN THIS HAPPENS. COINCIDENTALLY; ON THAT CALL WAS ANOTHER PILOT THAT HAD THE SAME THING HAPPENED TO THEM AT A DIFFERENT AIRPORT. AS WE HAVE BEEN RESEARCHING THIS WE ARE FINDING THERE IS NO STANDARDIZATION FROM AIRPORT TO AIRPORT ON THIS. SOME AIRPORTS HAVE WRITTEN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN ATC AND AIRPORT AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS DON'T. DOES THIS INFER THAT CERTAIN AIRPORTS TAKE SAFETY MORE SERIOUSLY THAN ANOTHER? IT IS FACTUAL THAT THE CAPTAIN WILL ALWAYS HAVE FINAL AUTHORITY. BUT SHOULDN'T ATC PROCEDURES ACROSS THE SYSTEM BE UNIFORM WITH REGARD TO CONCERNS WITH THE RUNWAY CONDITION? TO GIVE A TAKEOFF CLEARANCE WITH NO ATTEMPT TO INSPECT THE RUNWAY IN ORDER TO KEEP TRAFFIC MOVING SEEMS AT ODDS WITH A CULTURE OF SAFETY.,Air Carrier pilot reported they refused a takeoff clearance after the preceding departure reported a bird strike over the runway.,2020,11
634,202012,CALIFORNIA,DURING CRUISE AT 10;000 FEET MSL; ON A REVENUE FLIGHT ENROUTE TO BAKERSFIELD CALIFORNIA; I FLEW UNDERNEATH A SMALL UNIDENTIFIABLE OBJECT. WEATHER CONDITIONS AT THE TIME WERE VFR BUT HAZY; I WAS JUST CROSSING THE MOUNTAIN TOPS INTO THE FLAT LAND AROUND BAKERSFIELD WHEN THE EVENT HAPPENED; I WAS LOCATED ON THE 141 DEGREE RADIAL FROM THE SHAFTER (EHF) VOR AT APPROXIMATELY 35 DME. WHILE LOOKING AHEAD AND PILOTING; A SMALL LIGHT FROM OUTSIDE AND ABOVE ME CAUGHT MY EYE. WHEN I LOOKED UP I WAS FLYING 25 TO 50 FEET BELOW A SMALL ROUND OBJECT WITH WHAT LOOKED LIKE A LIGHT ON THE BOTTOM SIDE OF IT. I INITIALLY REPORTED THIS TO BAKERSFIELD APPROACH AS A DRONE; BUT I FLEW BY IT SO QUICKLY AND THE RANGE AT WHICH I SPOTTED IT; I CAN'T SAY WITH 100% CERTAINTY WHAT IT WAS. I WOULD SAY IT'S POSSIBLE IT COULD'VE BEEN A BALLOON WITH THE SUN REFLECTING OFF OF IT AS WELL. FORTUNATELY; NOTHING HAPPENED AND I PROCEEDED TO BAKERSFIELD FOR A NORMAL LANDING.BEING AS I DON'T KNOW 100% WHAT THE OBJECT WAS IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT 'CAUSED' IT. IF IT WAS IN FACT A DRONE AND NOT A BALLOON THEN IT WAS MOST LIKELY BEING ILLEGALLY OPERATED.UNFORTUNATELY DUE TO THE HAZE PREVENTING ME FROM SEEING IT SOONER; AND THE RATE OF CLOSURE WITH THE OBJECT THERE WASN'T ANY TIME TO REACT. I REPORTED THE EVENT TO BAKERSFIELD APPROACH.NOT MUCH TO SUGGEST OTHER THAN ASKING PILOTS TO REMAIN VIGILANT IN THEIR SCANS OUTSIDE AS BEST THEY CAN WITH THE GIVEN WEATHER CONDITIONS.,Pilot reported an encounter with either a drone or a balloon during cruise near Bakersfield; CA.,2020,12
635,202012,CALIFORNIA,I WAS CONDUCTING A PRIVATE FLIGHT IN MY AIRCRAFT.  I HAD UTILIZED VFR FLIGHT FOLLOWING AND WAS HANDED OFF TO TOWER.   I HEARD NUMEROUS BANGS IN QUICK SUCCESSION. THEY WERE ALARMING AND MY WIFE WHOM WAS IN THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT ABRUPTLY TURNED TO ME AND EXCLAIMED IN A CONCERNED TONE; 'WHAT WAS THAT'? I TOO WAS EXTREMELY CONCERNED AND BEGAN CHECKING ALL AIRCRAFT SYSTEMS. FORTUNATELY; ALL SYSTEMS WERE FUNCTIONING AND I CONTINUED THE APPROACH TO AN UNEVENTFUL LANDING. UPON EXAMINATION OF THE AIRCRAFT POST-LANDING; I NOTED DAMAGE TO THE FAIRING PROTRUDING FROM THE UNDERWING OF THE RIGHT MAIN LANDING GEAR. ALTHOUGH I DID NOT SEE WHAT CAUSED THE DAMAGE; I AM CERTAIN THE DAMAGE WAS NOT PRESENT BEFORE THE RETURN FLIGHT DUE TO MY PREFLIGHT INSPECTION. I SURMISE THE AIRCRAFT WAS STRUCK BY AN UNMANNED AERIAL SYSTEM AS THERE WERE NO SIGNS OF BLOOD OR FEATHERS CONSISTENT WITH A BIRD STRIKE.,A General Aviation pilot reported hearing banging noises on final approach and upon inspecting the aircraft after landing saw damage and believes it was caused by colliding with a UAV.,2020,12
636,202012,COLORADO,INITIAL APPROACH INTO DIA I ENCOUNTERED TWO SEPARATE LARGE DRONES THAT WERE IN THE BRAVO AIRSPACE WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION. ONE WAS AT MY LEVEL OFF TO THE RIGHT BY ABOUT A QUARTER TO HALF MILE. THE OTHER WAS WHILE IN THE DESCENT INTO THE AIRPORT SHORTLY AFTER THE FIRST ENCOUNTER. BOTH CREATED A COLLISION HAZARD AND CAUSE FOR ALARM. THE AIRCRAFT WAS IN A STATE OF PERIL AND THREATENED THE OPERATION. NO FURTHER INCIDENTS HAD OCCURRED AFTER ENTERING FINAL FOR RUNWAY 35L.,Air carrier Captain encountered two UAV's while on approach into Class Bravo Airport.,2020,12
637,202012,OKLAHOMA,ON LEFT DOWNWIND FOR RUNWAY 35L OKC AT 3;000 FEET; CO-PILOT REPORTED SEEING A QUAD-COPTER DRONE APPROXIMATELY 15 FEET FROM THE LEFT WING TIP.,Reporter on a small transport aircraft stated they had a conflict with a drone during approach to OKC airport.,2020,12
638,202101,CALIFORNIA,DRONE SIGHTED ON NORTH SIDE OF THE AIRCRAFT WITHIN 100 FEET. OVER FUELR INTERSECTION AT APPROXIMATELY 7;500 FEET SIGHTED A DRONE WITHIN 100 FEET OF THE AIRCRAFT. DRONE WAS CLEARLY VISIBLE.,Air carrier Captain reported an NMAC with a drone during final approach to LAX over FUELR intersection..,2021,01
639,202101,CALIFORNIA,I WAS ON TOP OF SCATTERED CLOUDS AT 5;500 FT. ARRIVING AT HAF FROM THE SOUTH. WEATHER REPORTS FROM THE AIRPORT ALL INDICATED THE AIRPORT WAS VFR. AS I APPROACHED THE IF FOR THE APPROACH I HAD TO DECIDE BETWEEN COORDINATING A POP UP APPROACH WITH APPROACH CONTROL OR DESCENDING THROUGH A LARGE OPENING IN THE CLOUD LAYER AND FLYING UP THE BEACH. I CHOSE TO REMAIN VFR AND FLY UP THE COAST DUE TO THE FACT THAT IT WAS GETTING DARK AND I HAD NO IDEA HOW LONG IT WOULD TAKE APPROACH CONTROL TO COORDINATE AN APPROACH. I DESCENDED UNEVENTFULLY BELOW THE CLOUDS AND PROCEEDED TO THE AIRPORT AT BETWEEN 1;000 AND 1;500 FT. OVER HILLS THAT VARY FROM 100 FT. TO 300 FT. HIGH. APPARENTLY THERE IS SOME DRONE OPERATOR WHO OPERATES OFF A HILL THAT GETS UPSET WHEN AIRCRAFT FLY OVER AT LOW ALTITUDE. HE CALLED ME RIGHT AFTER I HAD LANDED. HE TOLD ME HE 'I CAN NOT ENFORCE THIS BUT I AM REQUESTING THAT WE NOT FLY OVER HIS DRONE OPERATION'. I NEVER SAW A DRONE AND AM NOT SURE IF HE WAS OPERATING ONE AT THE TIME. TALKING TO OTHER PILOTS IT APPEARS HE CALLS EVERY PILOT HE SEES FLY OVER AT 1;500 FT. OR BELOW. I TYPICALLY FLY HIGHER BUT ON DAYS WHEN THE CEILINGS ARE 1;500 TO 2;000 FT. IT IS UNAVOIDABLE TO FLY LOW. I AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE DRONE OPERATOR CALLING PILOTS AND POSSIBLY INFLUENCING THEIR DECISIONS WHEN SACRIFICING SAFETY OF FLIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT VS. INCONVENIENCE OF THE DRONE OPERATOR.,A pilot reported a concerned citizen called them after landing to request that they do not fly over the citizens' 'drone operation'. The reporter stated other pilots who fly into this airport have also received phone calls from the same person.,2021,01
640,202101,GEORGIA,I WAS THE PM (PILOT MONITORING) AND THE CA (CAPTAIN) WAS THE PF (PILOT FLYING). I BELIEVE THE CA WAS HAND FLYING. WE WERE DESCENDING SOUTHBOUND ON A BASE LEG FOR A VISUAL TO RWY 26R IN ATL; WE ENCOUNTERED A DRONE AT CLOSE RANGE. WE WERE 13 MILES OR SO FROM THE ATL VOR; JUST OUTSIDE OF THE 12.0 DME ARC OF CLASS B AIRSPACE; WHICH EXISTS BETWEEN 3;000 - 12;500 FT. MSL. WE WERE DESCENDING OUT OF 5;200 FT. MSL OR SO; WHEN I SAW A DARK-COLORED DRONE; NORTHBOUND; AT APPROXIMATELY 4;900 FT. WE BOTH SAW IT ONCE IT WAS AT OUR 2:00 - 3:00 POSITION; SO EVASIVE ACTION WAS UNNECESSARY; BUT IT WAS WITHIN A WINGSPAN OR TWO FROM US. IT WAS ALSO 200 - 300 FT. BELOW OUR ALTITUDE AND WE WERE DESCENDING. WE REPORTED IT TO ATL TRACON. THEY ASKED THE PERTINENT QUESTIONS AND NOTIFIED AIRCRAFT BEHIND US; BUT; FROM WHAT I HEARD BEFORE LEAVING THE FREQUENCY; THERE WERE NO OTHER SIGHTINGS.,Air carrier flight crew observed a UAV within several hundred feet. Flight was in Class B airspace on base turn of approach.,2021,01
641,202102,ALABAMA,WE WERE LEFT BASE DESCENDING AT 1;800 FEET TURNING FINAL FOR A VISUAL LANDING 15 INTO MOB. AS IT ALL HAPPENS SO FAST THERE WAS NO TIME TO REACT IN THE MOMENT; BUT AS WE TURNED TO WHAT LOOKED LIKE A SINGLE LONE BIRD TURNED OUT TO BE A DRONE QUADCOPTER ZIPPED BY ME ON MY LEFT AT EYE LEVEL AND WENT DIRECTLY OVER OUR LEFT WING WITHIN 15 FEET. I IMMEDIATELY REPORTED THIS TO MOB TOWER DESCRIBED IT AS QUADCOPTER AT OUR ALTITUDE AND WITHIN 15 FEET OF THE AIRCRAFT AND THAT IF IT HAD BEEN ANY CLOSER IT WOULD'VE STRUCK US OR POTENTIALLY WENT INTO OUR LEFT ENGINE POSSIBLY CAUSING FAILURE. THIS DRONE WAS IN THE CRITICAL APPROACH CORRIDOR IN OUR PATH ON FINAL TO LAND. LUCKILY AFTER WE LANDED WE DID A THOROUGH PRE-FLIGHT AND  THERE WAS NO DAMAGE NOR EVIDENCE OF A COLLISION. I SAW THE DRONE AS WE QUICKLY PASSED IT IN A SPLIT SECOND.CAUSE - CARELESS DRONE OPERATOR OPERATING A DRONE ILLEGALLY IN VICINITY OF AIRPORT.ALWAYS BE VIGILANT OF THE AIRSPACE AND TREAT THEM AS IF THEY WERE BIRDS EVEN IF NOT ALWAYS AVOIDABLE. REPORT ANY SUCH ACTIVITY TO HOPEFULLY AVOID AN EMERGENCY IN THE FUTURE.,Air carrier flight crew reported an NMAC with a drone during approach to MOB airport.,2021,02
642,202102,FLORIDA,ON APPROACH INTO MCO; THE CAPTAIN IDENTIFIED A DRONE OFF OUR PORT SIDE AS WE WERE LANDING [RUNWAY] 18R. I WAS THE PILOT FLYING; HAD NO VISUAL ON THE DRONE; BUT WAS ADVISED OF IT.,Air carrier First Officer reported an airborne conflict with a drone during approach to MCO airport.,2021,02
643,202102,KENTUCKY,ON SHORT FINAL INTO SDF RWY 17R I NOTICED A SHINY OBJECT SLIGHTLY BELOW AND TO THE LEFT OF THE AIRCRAFT ON FINAL. IT WAS NOT DIRECTLY IN THE FLIGHT PATH BUT CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE NOTICED. I NOTED THAT AIRCRAFT WAS 3 MILES FROM THE RUNWAY AND 600 FEET AGL. THE DRONE WAS SLIGHTLY BELOW US (ESTIMATE 400 FEET) AND EAST OF THE EXTENDED CENTERLINE (ESTIMATE 2;500 FEET). AT FIRST; I THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A BALLOON; BUT RECOGNIZED IT AS A DRONE AS IT PASSED ABEAM AND BEHIND US. THE FO WAS FLYING AND GIVEN THE PHASE OF FLIGHT AND THAT I DID NOT FEEL THAT IT WAS AN IMMEDIATE THREAT; I ELECTED TO WAIT UNTIL WE WERE CLEAR OF THE RUNWAY TO INFORM THE FO AND GROUND CONTROL.,Air carrier Captain reported an airborne conflict with a drone during final approach to SDF airport.,2021,02
644,202102,MINNESOTA,DURING A CLIMBING LEFT TURN I HEARD A THUD. I ASKED THE CREW IF THEY HAD DROPPED SOMETHING AND THEY AFFIRMED THEY HAD NOT. I FELT LIKE WE HIT SOMETHING BECAUSE 9 TIMES OUT OF 10 I WOULD HAVE CONTINUED THE FLIGHT; CHALKING THE NOISE UP TO THE AIRCRAFT BEING COLD. WHEN I TURNED BACK I WAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED IN THE LEFT DOWNWIND WHICH WOULD PLACE ME APPROXIMATELY AT THE EDGE OF THE AIRPORT ENVIRONMENT. I WAS SCANNING THE AIR TO FIND WHAT WE HIT; AS I DID NOT SEE ANYTHING I ASSUMED IT WAS A COWLING THAT HAD POPPED DUE TO THE COLD AND VIBRATION. I LANDED ON THE CART AND LEFT THE AIRCRAFT RUNNING WHILE THE CREW AND I LOOKED OVER THE AIRCRAFT. WE WERE CANCELLED SO I SHUT DOWN; REFUELED; AND PLACED THE AIRCRAFT IN THE HANGAR. WHILE IN THE HANGER I WAS IMMEDIATELY ALERTED TO THE MAIN ROTOR BLADE. UPON INSPECTION I NOTICED A DENT ON THE LEADING EDGE AS WELL AS A HOLE STRAIGHT THROUGH THE CENTER OF THE BLADE. MY HEART SANK AND I THANKED GOD WE WERE ALIVE. THE FOLLOWING SHOCK SET IN AND I FELT IMMEDIATE GUILT. I RECALLED THE MORNING'S EVENTS AND REALIZED THAT I HAD NOT DONE A THOROUGH AIRCRAFT CHECK. I IMMEDIATELY CALLED MY SUPERVISORS AND TOLD THEM WHAT HAD HAPPENED AND WHAT I HAD FAILED TO DO. I AM EXTREMELY FRUSTRATED AT MYSELF AND ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMPLACENCY THAT I DISPLAYED.TRYING TO PROCESS WHAT LED ME TO MAKE THIS DECISION AS I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE A SAFE AND COMPETENT PILOT I RELIVED MY WEEK AT WORK. MY FIRST DAY BACK DURING PREFLIGHT I NOTICED THAT THE FLUID IN THE DAMPENER ON THE BLUE BLADE WAS LOW. I WROTE THIS DISCREPANCY UP IN THE AIRCRAFT LOGBOOK. IT WAS THEN SERVICED AND I LOOKED OVER THE ROTOR DISC. UPON SPEAKING WITH THE CREW I LEARNED OF A COMPLAINT ABOUT THE WORKSTATION LIGHT ABOVE THE PATIENT AND BROUGHT IT UP IN CONVERSATION WITH THE MECHANICS. WE SPOKE ABOUT TROUBLESHOOTING STEPS AND THEY RESET THE LIGHTS AND THE PROBLEM COULD NOT BE DUPLICATED. LATER I HAD A LATE FLIGHT AND TURNED OVER THE AIRCRAFT TO THE ONCOMING PILOT. I TOLD HIM ABOUT THE DAMPENER AND THAT WE WERE KEEPING A CLOSE EYE ON IT I ALSO WROTE UP THE WORKSTATION LIGHT AND DEFERRED IT AS IT WAS A NON ESSENTIAL FLIGHT ITEM. WHEN HE GOT THE AIRCRAFT BACK INTO THE HANGAR HE NOTICED THAT THE DAMPENER WAS EMPTY SO HE WROTE UP THE DISCREPANCY AND CALLED THE MECHANIC IN TO SERVICE THE DAMPENER. THIS WAS EXPLAINED TO ME AT SHIFT CHANGE THE FOLLOWING DAY AND DURING PREFLIGHT I AGAIN INSPECTED THE DAMPENER AND THE ROTOR SYSTEM. THE MECHANIC TOLD ME WE WERE REPLACING THE DAMPENER AND WE WOULD BE OUT OF SERVICE. I HAVE RACKED MY BRAIN OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I CANNOT WITH 100 PERCENT CERTAINTY SAY THAT I LOOKED OVER THE DAMPENER AFTER IT WAS REPLACED. I DO BELIEVE THAT I DID BECAUSE I REMEMBER THINKING 'THAT'S A CLEAN DAMPENER; LOOKS GREAT.' BUT I AM UNCERTAIN AS I LOOKED AT THOSE DAMPENERS SO MUCH THAT WEEK.I WAS WATCHING THE WORK GET DONE FOR SOME TIME AND I ALSO WITNESSED OUR MECHANICS INSPECT THE WORK UPON ITS COMPLETION. I FEEL VERY CONFIDENT IN BOTH OF OUR MECHANICS AND I TRUST THEIR WORK. MY PREFLIGHT FRIDAY MORNING WAS THOROUGH AND THE AIRCRAFT HAD NOT MOVED ALL DAY. I CHECKED IN WITH THE OFF GOING PILOT AND HE SAID THEY HADN'T FLOWN THE AIRCRAFT AND THE SHIP LOOKED GOOD. WE TALKED ABOUT THE DAMPENER AND HOW WE HOPE THAT THE NEW ONE WON'T LEAK DUE TO THE COLD. I CHECKED THE TEMPERATURE AND SAW IT WAS -26F WITH A 10 KT. WIND. I REFERENCED THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WINDCHILL CHART AND SAW THAT THOSE CONDITIONS PLACED US IN THE 10 MINUTE FROSTBITE EXPOSURE WINDOW AND BRIEFED THE CREW WE WOULD NOT BE ACCEPTING A FLIGHT UNTIL THE TEMPERATURE INCREASED. I BELIEVE AT THIS MOMENT I FELT LIKE I HAD ENOUGH TIME TO DRINK MY COFFEE AND THEN GO PRE FLIGHT. HOWEVER; TIME ESCAPED ME AND DID NOT MAKE IT TO THE SHIP BEFORE TONES WENT OFF. THE CREW AND I DID OUR WALK AROUND AND I THOUGHT BECAUSE THE SHIP HADN'T MOVED AND THAT I HAD DONE A THOROUGH PREFLIGHT THE DAY PRIOR THAT THE AIRCRAFT WAS AIRWORTHY. THIS WAS A MASSIVE LAPSE IN JUDGEMENT. I SHOULD HAVE RECONCILED WITH MY MISTAKE TO NOT PREFLIGHT IMMEDIATELY; AND PUT US ON A DELAY WHILE I PERFORMED A PREFLIGHT.MY BEST GUESS AS TO THE CAUSE OF THIS INCIDENT IS A DRONE STRIKE. I BELIEVE I IMPACTED A FLYING OBJECT AT AROUND 400 FT. JUST OUTSIDE THE AIRPORT ENVIRONMENT. I HAVE SEEN DRONES FLYING IN AROUND THIS AREA AND DRONE SIGHTINGS CONTINUE TO BE MORE FREQUENT IN THE AIR. AS I DID NOT SEE ANY DEBRIS POST IMPACT I CANNOT BE SURE OF THIS. THE NOISE AND IMPACT FELT SIMILAR TO A BIRD STRIKE; WHERE ITS LOUD ENOUGH TO RAISE AN EYEBROW BUT NOT SO LOUD THAT YOU THINK THERE IS A HOLE IN YOUR BLADE. I HAVE ALREADY LEARNED A GREAT DEAL FROM THIS EXPERIENCE AND ACCEPT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR MY ACTIONS. THANK YOU.,Helicopter pilot reported they overlooked a faulty dampener during their pre flight. Upon departure the pilot reported a Drone strike,2021,02
645,202102,TEXAS,WHILE FLYING A ROUTINE WEEKLY ROUTE I CAME ACROSS A VERY SMALL UNMANNED DRONE. I FLEW PAST HIM AT VERY CLOSE PROXIMITY. WHEN I FIRST NOTICED IT; I THOUGHT IT WAS A DISTANT AIRPLANE AND THEN THOUGHT MAYBE IT WAS A GLIDER. BUT IN A MATTER OF ABOUT 2 SECONDS I REALIZED IT WAS A DRONE; MUCH SLOWER THAN ME IN WHICH I HAD TO DEVIATE TO AVOID. THIS DRONE WAS FLYING AT MY ALTITUDE OF APPROXIMATELY 600-700 FEET AGL. WHEN I FIRST SAW THE DRONE IT WAS NEAR MY 1 O'CLOCK POSITION AND WITHIN 3-4 SECONDS IT FLEW IN FRONT OF ME AND TOWARDS MY 10 O'CLOCK POSITION. I WAS SURPRISED THE DRONE WAS FLY AT AN ALTITUDE NEAR 600 FEET AGL. I'M GLAD THEY PAINT THEM GLOSSY WHITE; IT DID HELP IT TO STAND OUT.,C182 pilot reported that while flying at low altitudes between 500-1;000 feet AGL came within 200 feet of a small UAS.,2021,02
646,202102,VIRGINIA,GOT TO LOCATION FAILED TO RESEARCH THE AIRSPACE. WAS RELYING ON THE MANUFACTURE'S GEO FENCING TO GUIDE ME WITH AIRSPACE. VIOLATION WAS DISCOVERED BY COMPANY UAS COORDINATOR. VIOLATION WAS DISCUSSED AND CORRECTIVE ACTION FOR FURTHER USE IS UNDERSTOOD. WE DISCUSSED AND NOW UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GEO FENCING AND THE NAS. I GOING FURTHER; WILL LOOK UP AIRSPACE BEFORE FLIGHTS. I WILL NOT FLY IN CONTROLLED AIRSPACE WITHOUT PROPER AUTHORIZATION.,A UAS pilot reported an airspace violation.,2021,02
647,202102,WASHINGTON,ON DEPARTURE FROM SEA; ATC WARNED US THAT A DRONE HAD BEEN SIGHTED AT APPROXIMATELY 6;000 FEET AT THE CLOUD TOPS IN THE VICINITY OF OUR FLIGHT PATH. BOTH MY FIRST OFFICER AND I MAINTAINED A LOOKOUT. CLIMBING THROUGH 6;100 FEET; I SPOTTED THE DRONE ABOUT 200 FEET OFF MY RIGHT SIDE; ABOUT 100 FEET BELOW OUR ALTITUDE. DUE TO THE CLOUDS AND SMALL SIZE OF THE DRONE; I SPOTTED IT LESS THAN ONE SECOND BEFORE WE CROSSED ITS POSITION. HAD THERE BEEN A CONFLICT; I WOULD NOT HAVE HAD ENOUGH SPACE TO EXECUTE AN AVOIDANCE MANEUVER. THE DRONE NEAR MISS WAS PROMPTLY REPORTED TO ATC WITH THE RECOMMENDATION TO NOT SEND ANY AIRCRAFT THROUGH THIS AIRSPACE. THERE WERE NO TCAS INDICATIONS OF THE DRONE. A TIMELY REPORT FROM ATC ALERTED US TO THAT HAZARD; BUT ATC DID NOT PROVIDE ANY SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS TO AVOID THE TRAFFIC.ATC KNEW A DRONE WAS OPERATING IN THE VICINITY OF NEVJO; BUT CONTINUED TO SEND AIRCRAFT ON THE SUMMA 2 DEPARTURE. A SIMPLE VECTOR ON DEPARTURE WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED THIS POTENTIAL THREAT TO OUR AIRCRAFT. THE DRONE WAS LARGE ENOUGH AND OUR RATE OF CLOSURE WAS GREAT ENOUGH; THAT IF COULD HAVE CAUSED SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO OUR AIRCRAFT HAD THERE BEEN A MIDAIR COLLISION.,Air carrier Captain reported an NMAC with a drone during departure from SEA airport.,2021,02
648,202103,CALIFORNIA,NEAR MIDAIR COLLISION WITH A PERSONAL 'DRONE' REMOTELY PILOTED AERIAL VEHICLE; ROUGHLY 18' SQUARE IN SIZE. OCCURRED ON THE SCBBY2 ARRIVAL; TAKOE TSN FOR RWY 26R; AT 6;000 FEET MSL; 3.5NM EAST OF KALEA INTERSECTION. FO (FIRST OFFICER) WAS PILOT FLYING AND PICKED UP TALLY OFF THE NOSE INSIDE .5 NM; LOW-HI; RAPIDLY MOVING FROM RIGHT TO LEFT. JUMPSEATER ALSO GAINED VISUAL SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AT THE LEFT COCKPIT WINDOW #2. BOTH FO AND JUMPSEATER ESTIMATE THE DRONE PASSED LESS THAN 50 FEET IN ELEVATION FROM THE LEFT WING AND CERTAINLY WITHIN THE LATERAL WINGSPAN DISTANCE OF THE AIRCRAFT; WHICH CONFIRMED THE VISUAL ID OF A DRONE VS. A BIRD. CAPTAIN WAS PILOT MONITORING AND DID NOT SEE THE DRONE BUT REPORTED LOCATION; ALTITUDE; TIME; AND GENERAL DESCRIPTION TO SOCAL APPROACH MOMENTS AFTER THE INCIDENT WITH THE INFORMATION FO PASSED TO HIM. WE CONTINUED THE APPROACH TO LAND WITHOUT INCIDENT.,Air carrier Captain reported a NMAC with a UAV in SCT airspace.,2021,03
649,202103,CALIFORNIA,ON CLIMB OUT AT SFO; ON INITIAL CONTACT WITH DEPARTURE CONTROL ATC ADVISED US THAT THE PRECEDING AIRCRAFT REPORTED A DRONE NEAR OAK AT APPROXIMATELY 4;000 FT. AFTER FLAP RETRACTION I DEEMED IT PRUDENT TO MAINTAIN A BEST RATE OF CLIMB TILL OUT OF 4;000 FT. AT AROUND 3;600 FT. THE FO (FIRST OFFICER) VERBALIZED HE HAD VISUAL CONTACT WITH THE DRONE POINTING TO THE 11 O'CLOCK POSITION. SHORTLY AFTER; I THEN ESTABLISHED VISUAL CONTACT. THE DRONE PASSED JUST TO OUR LEFT AND UNDER US. I WOULD ESTIMATE WE CAME TO APPROXIMATELY 500 FT. OF IT. ATC WAS NOTIFIED AND FLIGHT PROCEEDED TO DESTINATION WITHOUT FURTHER INCIDENT.I'M ASSUMING THE DRONE WAS NOT BEING OPERATED UNDER ANY LEGAL CLEARANCE. FURTHERMORE THE DRONE HAD NO TRANSPONDER MAKING OUR TCAS USELESS IN THIS CASE. I AM PLEASED WITH MY DECISION TO MAINTAIN A GOOD RATE OF CLIMB UNTIL CLEAR OF DRONE.UNFORTUNATELY DRONE SIGHTINGS AROUND BUSY AIRPORTS ARE BECOMING MORE RAMPANT. AND LIKE BIRD STRIKES; VERY LITTLE IS KNOWN EXACTLY WHAT TYPE OF DAMAGE CAN OCCUR TO A JET AIRLINER IF A COLLISION OCCURS. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE FAA AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WILL DO WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE AIRSPACE THAT IS CRUCIAL FOR SAFETY OF FLIGHT.,Air carrier flight crew reported a NMAC with a drone.,2021,03
650,202103,CALIFORNIA,ON A 14 MILE FINAL RUNWAY 24R LAX AIRPORT [AT] 4300 MSL I SPOTTED A DRONE APPROACH ANOTHER AIRPLANE AT OUR 10:00 POSITION ON PARALLEL FINAL RWY 25R OFF THEIR RIGHT WING.  DRONE THEN TURNED AND FLEW OFF OF OUR LEFT WING TIP OPPOSITE DIRECTION AT AN ESTIMATED DISTANCE OF 300 FEET.  IT APPEARED TO BE A SILVER QUAD PROPELLER DRONE BUT NOT TOTALLY POSITIVE.,Air carrier Captain noticed a drone within 300 feet of their flight path during final approach.,2021,03
651,202103,CALIFORNIA,I AM REPORTING THIS IN THE INTEREST OF FLIGHT SAFETY AND FOR THE FURTHERANCE OF DRONE OPERATIONS IN THE NAS (NATIONAL AIRSPACE SYSTEM). FOR EXPERIENCE IN THE HOURS TO CLARIFY I WENT TO FLIGHT SCHOOL AND EARNED A PPL (PRIVATE PILOT LICENSE) AND HAVE ROUGHLY X00 HOURS FLIGHT IN HELICOPTERS COMBINED WITH INSTRUMENT AND COMMERCIAL TYPE TRAINING; ALONG WITH XX HOURS OF FIXED WING FLIGHT EXPERIENCE. 10 HOURS IN DRONES HOWEVER THAT IS MEASURED IN FLIGHT LOGS STORED WITHIN THE AIRCRAFT FLIGHT LOGS AND IS SUBJECT TO SOME ERROR LIKE ALL THINGS ARE. THE ISSUE THANKFULLY INVOLVED NOTHING MORE THAN A CITATION FROM LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT; HOWEVER THE ISSUE WAS THAT I WAS HIRED TO FILM [AN EVENT] THAT WAS NOT PERMITTED (SOMETHING I DID NOT KNOW). THE OTHER ISSUE WAS THAT THE AREA I WAS OPERATING IN [AN AREA] ON THE SAN FRANCISCO SECTIONAL CHART AS NO FLIGHT BELOW 1;000 FT. AGL. I WAS AWARE OF THIS AREA AND KNEW APPROXIMATELY WHERE IT WAS BUT AT THE TIME BELIEVED IT TO BE MUCH FARTHER NORTH. THE ISSUE WITH DRONE OPERATIONS VS. COMMERCIAL MANNED AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS IS THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS BUILT AROUND MANNED FLIGHT AND TO PRECISELY PINPOINT A PHYSICAL ADDRESS ON A SECTIONAL IS QUITE CUMBERSOME. FOR THE MOST PART A SECTIONAL IS HELPFUL FOR AREAS IN GENERAL BUT YOU COULD LITERALLY FIND YOURSELF OPERATING INSIDE A HOLE WITHIN SEVERAL BOUNDARIES. THIS IS WHERE APPLICATIONS SUCH AS AIRMAP; B4UFLY; AND UASIDEKICK CAN BE A HUGE HELP IN CHECKING AND RE-CHECKING AN AREA. I DO UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY FALLS ONTO THE PIC IN THIS CASE AND THAT I SHOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DILIGENT AND THIS IS A LESSON LEARNED. BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE THAT PROFESSIONAL OPERATORS WOULD BE PULLING OUT PLOTTERS FOR EVERY ADDRESS THEY FLY AT TO PINPOINT THE COORDINATES. MY CONCERN LIES WITH THE APPLICATIONS ACCURACY NOT THAT THE DEVELOPERS DO NOT TRY BUT 4 OF THE TOP APPLICATIONS DID NOT ALERT ME TO AN AIRSPACE ISSUE; THIS ALONG WITH MY PRESUMED THOUGHT THAT THE RESTRICTION WAS MUCH FARTHER NORTH LET ME TO BELIEVE I HAD THE ALL CLEAR. AS DRONE OPERATORS THE ONLY OFFICIAL SOURCE WE HAVE IS ONE THAT IS GEARED TOWARDS MANNED FLIGHT AND AS USAGE CONTINUES TO GROW MY FEAR IS THAT A MORE SERIOUS INCURSION IS INEVITABLE. HELICOPTERS OPERATORS HAVE A CHART THAT IS MOST HELPFUL TO THEM WHEN OPERATING AT LOW LEVEL; AND THIS IS VERY HELPFUL AS I HAVE USED THESE TO NAVIGATE LOS ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO CLASS B. DRONES ARE AN EMERGING BUSINESS AND AS A RESPONSIBLE OPERATOR I AM ALWAYS CONCERNED ABOUT FLIGHT SAFETY. BUT USAGE IS ONLY INCREASING; SOMETHING AS SIMPLE AS DOING A ROOF INSPECTION OF A RESIDENTIAL HOME REDUCES RISK INCREASES PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPROVES THE ACCURACY AND LEVEL OF SERVICE. DRONES MAY BE SMALL BUT THEY ARE MAKING A HUGE IMPACT.,Part 107 pilot was flying in an area they believed to be available for UAS operations. After further review the pilot learned they were in fact in airspace not available to UAS operations which was not noted by any of the UAS apps.,2021,03
652,202103,FLORIDA,WHEN CHECKING IN WITH MCO FINAL APPROACH CONTROL WE WERE GIVEN SPEED REDUCTION 190 TO MKR (MARKER RADIO BEACON); DRONES REPORTED NEAR ORL EXECUTIVE; ALL TRAFFIC NOW ARRIVING RUNWAY 17L AND R. CLEARED VISUAL RUNWAY 17L MAINTAIN GS ON APPROACH SLOW TO 170. CAUTION TRAFFIC ON RIGHT TO RUNWAY 17R; CONTACT TOWER ON FREQ. WE RECEIVED OUR LANDING CLEARANCE FOR RUNWAY 17L. SECOND BIRDS ON PATH SITING. WE WERE ON REF AND GS. ABOUT 1;100 FT. I REALIZED WE WEREN'T FULLY CONFIGURED. CALLED FOR GEAR/F3 THEN F FULL/LANDING CHECKLIST. LANDING CHECKLIST COMPLETED BY 800 FT. WE WERE STILL AT REF AND ON GS FULLY STABLE; WE LANDED NORMALLY AND TAXIED OFF AT TAXIWAY F. WE RECEIVED NO ALERTS DURING APPROACH.I BELIEVE WE WERE DISTRACTED MORE THAN USUAL AS WELL AS FEELING A LITTLE TIRED THAT AFTERNOON. I WILL MOST ASSUREDLY USE THIS EXPERIENCE AS A LEARNING EXAMPLE OF AVOIDING POTENTIAL COMPLACENCY BY CAREFULLY APPLYING OUR PROCEDURES TO PREVENT ANY RE OCCURRENCE GOING FORWARD.,Air carrier Captain reported failing to properly configure for the approach due to distraction and fatigue.,2021,03
653,202103,OHIO,DURING AN AERIAL SURVEY FLIGHT AT APPROXIMATELY 16;500 FEET THE FLIGHT CREW OBSERVED A DRONE PASS 1 TO 2 FEET OVER THE LEFT WING TIP OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE DRONE WAS ESTIMATED 3 TO 5 FEET IN DIAMETER. IT APPEARED TO BE A WHITE COLOR. IT HAPPENED TOO QUICKLY TO DESCRIBE THE SHAPE AND DIMENSIONS WITH ANY DEGREE OF ACCURACY. SAME GOES FOR THE DIRECTION OF THE CRAFT. THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN ABSOLUTELY NO CHANCE OF TAKING EVASIVE ACTION GIVEN HOW FAST THE EVENT OCCURRED. SAME COMPANY HAS OBSERVED A DRONE AT 15;500 [FEET.] WITH A SIMILAR SIZE AND A NEAR MISS WITHIN 20 FEET IN THE PAST.,A Pilot conducting an Aerial Survey mission reported a near miss with a unmanned aerial vehicle.,2021,03
654,202103,OREGON,AIRCRAFT X CHECKED IN FROM 40 MILES NORTH OF THE AIRPORT REQUESTING OPPOSITE DIRECTION ARRIVAL RUNWAY 14.  I COORDINATED WITH MEDFORD TOWER AND THEY DENIED IT DUE TO AN AIRCRAFT WITH A CONTROLLED DEPARTURE TIME EVEN THOUGH THE DEPARTURE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A FACTOR. I TOLD AIRCRAFT X UNABLE AND THEY REQUESTED THE RNAV 32 APPROACH VIA SAMIE SO I CLEARED THEM FOR THE APPROACH VIA SAMIE AT OR ABOVE 10;000 FEET. AS AIRCRAFT X WAS FOLLOWING THE COURSE A VFR TAG POPPED UP NEAR THE APPROACH PATH ABOUT 11 MILES SOUTH OF THE AIRPORT (THEY APPEARED TO DEPART FROM AN UNCONTROLLED AIRPORT THAT IS DIRECTLY IN THE APPROACH PATH) SO I ISSUED TRAFFIC MULTIPLE TIMES AND GAVE AIRCRAFT X AN ALTITUDE RESTRICTION FOR TRAFFIC BUT WHEN AIRCRAFT X GOT CLOSER TO THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGET THE TARGET CLIMBED AND TURNED AT THE AIRCRAFT X RESULTING IN A TCAS RA AT WHICH POINT THE AIRCRAFT X CLIMBED AND EVENTUALLY REQUESTED AN ALTITUDE TO MAINTAIN AND WANTED LOWER FOR A VISUAL APPROACH. DUE TO TERRAIN I WAS UNABLE TO DESCEND THEM LOW ENOUGH AND HAD TO ISSUE VECTORS AROUND FOR THE ILS 14 APPROACH WHICH THE AIRCRAFT CONDUCTED AND LANDED SAFELY. I THEN HAD ANOTHER ARRIVAL REQUESTING THE RNAV 32 APPROACH AND THE UNIDENTIFIED TARGET WAS STILL A FACTOR.THE RNAV 32 APPROACH FLIES DIRECTLY OVER AN UNCONTROLLED AIRPORT THAT IS FREQUENTLY USED BY VFR AIRCRAFT AND ALSO FOLLOWS A VERY BUSY VFR AREA OVER A HIGHWAY THAT AIRCRAFT NOT ON FLIGHT FOLLOWING USE FOR NAVIGATION. THIS APPROACH IS INHERENTLY DANGEROUS DUE TO THE NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT THAT FLY ALONG IT'S PATH WITHOUT COMMUNICATION WITH APPROACH CONTROL AND BECAUSE IT FLIES THROUGH A VALLEY BETWEEN MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN GIVING ATC FEW OPTIONS TO AVOID CONFLICT WITH AIRCRAFT THAT CAN'T BE SEEN BY OUR RADAR UNTIL REACHING ABOVE 4;000 FEET. I RECOMMEND THAT MEDFORD AIRPORT SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO ADVERTISE RUNWAY 14 ARRIVALS WITH RUNWAY 32 DEPARTURES. WHOEVER DECIDED THAT WE CAN'T ADVERTISE THAT NEEDS TO COME HAVE A LOOK AT THE ARRIVAL/DEPARTURE PROCEDURES AVAILABLE AT MEDFORD AND GIVE AN ACTUAL ANSWER AS TO WHY? RUNWAY 32 ARRIVALS ARE MUCH MORE DANGEROUS TO AIRCRAFT THAN RUNWAY 14 DUE TO MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN; AND RUNWAY 14 DEPARTURES ARE FAR MORE DANGEROUS WHEN ALSO ARRIVING RUNWAY 14 BECAUSE THE DEPARTURE PROCEDURE FOR RUNWAY 14 TURNS AIRCRAFT AROUND DIRECTLY IN THE FACE OF AIRCRAFT ARRIVING RUNWAY 14 CREATING AN OPPOSITE DIRECTION CONFLICT WITH FAR LESS CONTROL AND RESTRICTION THAN WE WOULD HAVE WITH A 14 ARRIVAL AND 32 DEPARTURE. OPPOSITE DIRECTION OPERATIONS REQUIRES A 10 MILE CUTOFF WHERE THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION CONFLICT CREATED BY A RUNWAY14 ARRIVAL WITH A RUNWAY 14 DEPARTURE DOES NOT ALLOW US TO TURN AIRCRAFT UNTIL A MUCH HIGHER ALTITUDE RESULTING IN RISKY BEHAVIOR.  RUNWAY 32 EVEN HAS A DEPARTURE PROCEDURE THAT PROVIDES SAFE DIVERGENCE FROM OPPOSITE DIRECTION ARRIVALS CALLED THE EAGLE 6 DEPARTURE. UNTIL SOMEONE ACTUALLY COMES TO THE FACILITY AND UNDERSTANDS THE DANGERS OF NOT BEING ABLE TO ADVERTISE RUNWAY 14 ARRIVALS WITH RUNWAY 32 DEPARTURES THERE WILL BE MANY MORE CLOSE CLOSE CALLS THAT COULD HAVE BEEN SAFELY PREVENTED. IT IS AN EASY FIX WITH AMAZING BENEFITS FOR CONTROLLERS; PILOTS; AND PREVENTING AIR CARRIER DELAYS.,EUG TRACON Controller reported an unidentified VFR aircraft climbed into confliction with an Air Carrier on an RNAV Approach causing the Air carrier to respond to a TCAS/RA. The reporter states this is a recurring traffic situation in their airspace,2021,03
655,202103,TEXAS,THE FLIGHT OPERATED FROM ZZZ TO GRK FOLLOWING THE THE ZZZZZ DEPARTURE TO ZZZZZ1 INTERSECTION AND THEN DIRECT TO THE AIRPORT. THIS ROUTE BRINGS FLIGHTS FROM THE EAST TO THE AIRPORT JUST SOUTH OF MULTIPLE RESTRICTED AREAS. AT APPROXIMATELY 12-15 MILES EAST OF THE GRK AT 4;000 FEET; WE ACCEPTED A VISUAL APPROACH CLEARANCE FOR RUNWAY 15. WE NOTED THE RESTRICTED AREAS TO THE NORTH OF THE FIELD AND MADE A 'DOGLEG' DOWNWIND TO BASE FOR THE RUNWAY WITH A COURSE CORRECTION TO AVOID RESTRICTED AREAS TO THE NORTHEAST; FOLLOWED BY A TURN JUST INSIDE THE PUBLISHED ILS RUNWAY 15 FAF FOR A NORMAL LANDING. UPON TOUCHING DOWN SUPERVISOR WISHED TO SPEAK TO OUR CREW AND OR MANAGEMENT TO INQUIRE ABOUT PROCEDURES INTO THE AIRPORT.BASED ON MY DISCUSSION WITH THE ATC MANAGER ON DUTY AT GRAY APPROACH; THERE HAVE BEEN MULTIPLE OCCASIONS WHERE OTHER AIRCRAFT HAVE PENETRATED RESTRICTED AIRSPACE AND HAVE HAD NEAR MISS COLLISIONS WITH MILITARY UAV'S THAT TOOK EVASIVE ACTION. IN SOME CASES THE THE RESTRICTED AIRSPACE IS WITHIN 3 MILES OF THE 15 RUNWAY EAST DOWNWIND. PER THE TRAFFIC MANAGER; CONTROLLERS EXPECT CREWS TO FLY A TRADITIONAL BOX PATTERN WHILE EXECUTING VISUAL APPROACHES ON LEFT DOWNWIND LEGS TO 15 AT A RATHER CLOSE DISTANCE; OR ENTER A MIDFIELD CROSSWIND ENTRY TO A RIGHT DOWNWIND. THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC INSTRUCTIONS FROM ATC AT THE TIME OF A VISUAL CLEARANCE TO FLY A SPECIFIC PATTERN. I RECOMMEND ADDITIONAL COORDINATION BETWEEN COMPANY MANAGEMENT; UNION; AND GRAY ATC TO DEVELOP SET OF PROCEDURES AND OR ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE/RECOMMENDATIONS FOR OUR FLIGHTS THAT CAN INCORPORATED INTO 10-7 STATION PAGES.,Air carrier Captain reported an restricted airspace violation near GRK and was told this is a common occurrence; which sometimes results in conflicts with military drones.,2021,03
656,202103,TEXAS,WHILE ON THE VISUAL APPROACH INTO HOU ON THE ILS 4. THE FO (FIRST OFFICER) WAS PILOT FLYING AND WHILE HE WAS FLYING THE APPROACH I NOTICED WHAT I THOUGHT WERE TWO BIRDS JUST TO THE RIGHT OF THE AIRCRAFT AT AROUND 9 O'CLOCK BUT OUTSIDE THE COURSE. I MADE THE FO AWARE OF THIS AND CONTINUED TO KEEP SCANNING FOR MORE BIRDS IN THE AREA SINCE THE FIRST ONE I SAW WAS WELL CLEAR OF OUR COURSE. HOWEVER AT 2;300 FT. AND 0.5NM PAST ELREN ON THE ILS 4 THE TWO OBJECTS WERE ACTUALLY DRONES THAT PAST OFF OUR RIGHT HAND SIDE THAT WERE THE SIZE OF TWO BIG BIRDS. I NOTICED THE TWO WERE INDEED DRONES BECAUSE I SAW THE PROPELLERS ON TWO OF THEM AND THEY HAD A SHINY BLACK FINISH ON THEM. I ALSO CHECKED THE TCAS TO SEE IF THEY WERE THERE; BUT IT DIDN'T SHOW THEM ON THE SCREEN. I RELAYED THIS INFORMATION TO HOU TOWER AND TOLD THEM WHAT ALTITUDE AND WHERE THEY WERE. UPON LANDING AND TAXING OFF THE RUNWAY AND CONTACTING GROUND; I WAS GIVEN A PHONE NUMBER TO CALL THE TOWER TO GIVE THEM MORE INFORMATION ON THE DESCRIPTION OF THE DRONES; AND WHERE I SPOTTED THEM ON THE APPROACH.MY SUGGESTION IS TO ALWAYS KEEP SCANNING THE AREA FOR ANY HAZARDS WHILE FLYING EVEN IF THE TCAS SYSTEM DOESN'T SHOW ANYTHING IN THE AREA.,Air carrier flight crew noticed drone while on final approach to landing.,2021,03
657,202103,VIRGINIA,I MISSED A SMALL SILVER QUAD COPTER UAS BY APPROXIMATELY 100 FEET.  MY ALTITUDE AT THIS POINT WAS ABOUT 2;000 AGL.  I REPORTED THE NEAR-MISS TO LEESBURG TOWER; THEY COLLECTED THE SAME INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT. AS I UNDERSTAND IT; UAS MAY NOT BE OPERATED ABOVE 400 AGL WITHOUT A WAIVER; THEREFORE THE PERSON OPERATING THAT UAS WAS LIKELY DOING SO ILLEGALLY.  THE AREA WHERE THIS OCCURRED IS JUST OUTSIDE THE LEESBURG MANEUVERING AREA OF THE DC SFRA AND THEREFORE IS QUITE BUSY WITH TRAFFIC GOING TO AND FROM JYO. I STRONGLY SUPPORT ANY EFFORTS TO COMPEL ALL UAS OPERATORS TO EQUIP WITH ADS-B OUT SO THAT OTHER AIRCRAFT CAN HAVE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS.,General aviation pilot was on climb out when a UAV came within 100 feet of their aircraft.,2021,03
658,202104,CALIFORNIA,I WAS FLYING MY DJI AIRCRAFT RECREATIONALLY AT XA:15 AT THE SAN DIEGO HARBOR DURING MY DJI DRONE'S FLIGHT ON ITS RETURN TO HOME AUTOMATION WHEN A LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIAL ASKED ME FOR MY LICENSE AND REGISTRATION. I TOLD HIM THAT I WAS A RECREATIONAL PILOT ON SITE AND HAD A SELF UNLOCKING LICENSE FROM DJI FLY APP TO FLY AT SAN DIEGO INTL AREA.HE TOLD ME THAT I WAS TOO CLOSE TO THE AIRPORT (2.5 MILES AWAY) AND THAT I DIDN'T HAVE PERMISSION FROM THE TOWER OR A PERMIT FROM THE HARBOR. HE ALSO TOLD ME THAT I NEED TO HAVE MY DJI AIRCRAFT REGISTERED AND DISPLAYED AT ALL TIMES AND GAVE A ME A TICKET FOR NOT COMPLYING WITH FAA REGISTRATION. HE NOTIFIED ME LATER THAT I NEEDED A 107 LICENSE AND THAT MY DJI AIRCRAFT NEEDED TO BE REGISTERED AND DISPLAYED CORRECTLY ON THE DRONE AT ALL TIMES. I AM SELF REPORTING BECAUSE I WAS UNAWARE AND BELIEVED AT THE TIME THAT I HAD ACQUIRED ALL MEASURES I NEED TO FLY THERE. I AIM TO ALWAYS FLY SAFELY AND SHARE THE SKIES RESPONSIBLY.I WAS UNAWARE THAT I HAD MISSED STEPS TO SAFELY AND LEGALLY FLY OVER THE WATER IN THAT AREA.,Hobbyist drone pilot was unaware he was flying in controlled airspace until approached by law enforcement official.,2021,04
659,202104,CALIFORNIA,WHILE ON AN IFR TRAINING FLIGHT FROM ZZZ TO ZZZ1 WE WERE ON AN IFR FLIGHT PLAN AT 10;000 FT. AND IN VMC CONDITIONS. ATC CALLED A DRONE AND CHASE PLANE AT 11 O'CLOCK AND TEN MILES CROSSING OUR PATH LEFT TO RIGHT AT THE SAME ALTITUDE.
